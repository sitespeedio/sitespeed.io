CHANGELOG sitespeed.io

version 2.0
------------------------
Major changes
------
* You can now choose which data that is showed in the summary boxes (the red/yellow/green ones on the start page) and the columns on the detailed summary page.
* You can also create your own box with your own data on the summary page and your own columns and data on the detailed summary page.
* Fetch Navigation Timing API data from a real browser, using Browser Time.
* New modified rule: the YSlow rule yimgnoscale doesn't work with PhantomJS. The new rule comapare the image browser width and the real image width.
* The main script (sitespeed.io) has been cleaned up & Velocity templates has been restructured.
* You can now test multiple sites and compare them using the sitespeed-sites.io script (you can choose what kind of data to compare).
* There are now two different rule-sets, one for desktop & one for mobile.

Minor changes
------
* You can now configure the limits for the rules on the summary page. 
* Phone view on detailed summary page now only contains url & score to make it simplier to maintain.
* You can now see the IP of the computer running the test in the result.xml file.
* You can now set the max pages to test & the name of the test (displayed on every HTML page).
* Simplified user agent by choosing between iphone, ipad or nexus and a real agent & viewport is set.
* Output as CSV: Choose which column to output and always output ip, start url & date.
* Fix for Windows-users that is having spaces in their path to Java.
* Bug fix: URL:s that returns error (4XX-5XX and that sitespeed can't analyze) is now included in the JUnit xml.
* Bug fix: The JUnit script can now output files to a relative path.
* Bug fix: User Agent is now correctly set.

version 1.8.3
------------------------
* Supply a test name that will be shown on all pages. Use the the parameter -n 
* Well the problem is like this: Today there is no way to get the ttfb from PhantomJS so it is fetched by a extra request using curl. Some sites that don't cache internally (and are slow) can differ quite much for ttfb, meaning ttfb can be higher the next request than the load time the first time. If this happens it is now highlighted.
* Bug fix: show median front/back end time instead of percentile on summary page 
* Bug fix: dwhen the ttfb is larger than pageload, don't add it to summary stats
* Bug fix: for some sites (very rarely) the total weight was fetched wrong by YSlow, fixed last release for all pages except summary & summary details.

------------------------
* Show percentage of requests & size per content type
* You can now export the pages data to csv (again) with the switch "-o csv"
* Upgraded the crawler: Better closing of connections, URL:s that not following RFC 2396 gave null pointers & when a cookie is not following the spec, the url of the page setting the cookie is now logged 
* On detailes page summary: Categorize favicon as favicon instead of others, and doc type has now an own category
* If an analyze failes, the url and the error from YSlow is now logged

* Cleanup: Removed old JS table sorter on pages summary, works better now
* Bug fix: If a page was redirected, the gzipped size was fetched as 0, now fixed
* Bug fix: For some sites (example www.bike.se) the total weight was fetched wrong by YSlow, now the weight is calculated from each assets on the pages info page.
* Bug fix: Urls containing & broke some tests
* Bug fix: In very rare cases, YSlow reports a larger cache weight than the page weight. The bug is not fixed but when it happens, an error mesage is displayed
