Major changes

* You can also create your own box with your own data on the summary page and your own columns and data on the detailed summary page.
* Fetch Navigation Timing API data from a real browser, using Browser Time.
* New modified rule: the YSlow rule yimgnoscale doesn't work with PhantomJS. The new rule compare the image browser width and the real image width.
* The main script (sitespeed.io) has been cleaned up & Velocity templates has been restructured.
* You can now test multiple sites and compare them using the sitespeed-sites.io script (you can choose what kind of data to compare).
* There are now two different rule-sets, one for desktop & one for mobile.

Minor changes
------

version 1.8.3
------------------------
* Supply a test name that will be shown on all pages. Use the the parameter -n 
* Well the problem is like this: Today there is no way to get the ttfb from PhantomJS so it is fetched by a extra request using curl. Some sites that don't cache internally (and are slow) can differ quite much for ttfb, meaning ttfb can be higher the next request than the load time the first time. If this happens it is now highlighted.
* Bug fix: show median front/back end time instead of percentile on summary page 
* Bug fix: when the ttfb is larger than pageload, don't add it to summary stats

* Cleanup: Removed old JS table sorter on pages summary, works better now
* Bug fix: If a page was redirected, the gzipped size was fetched as 0, now fixed
* Bug fix: For some sites (example www.bike.se) the total weight was fetched wrong by YSlow, now the weight is calculated from each assets on the pages info page.
* Bug fix: Urls containing & broke some tests
* Bug fix: In very rare cases, YSlow reports a larger cache weight than the page weight. The bug is not fixed but when it happens, an error message is displayed
