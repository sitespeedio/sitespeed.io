## 12.7.1 - 2020-04-29
### Fixed
* 12.7.0 broke sending groups when you used URL alias. Fixed in [#2973](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2973).
* Correctly send messages on html.finished message, thank youÂ [Erick Wilder](https://github.com/erickwilder) for the PR[#2971](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2971).
* Updated to [Browsertime 8.8.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#880---2020-04-29) that fixes the Firefox error that sometimes happend introduced in 8.7.0.

## 12.7.0 - 2020-04-27
### Added
* Use loadEventEnd for budget, summary box and page summary [#2969](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2969).
* Configurable group names. Use `--groupAlias` to assing an alias to a group (that is used in Graphite/InfluxDB). Use one alias per URL. [#2964](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2964)
* Upgraded to [Browsertime 8.7.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#870---2020-04-24):

  * With the great merge of Mozillas changes I've missed to make sure the result.json wasn't bloated. [Gregory Mierzwinski](https://github.com/gmierz) fixed this in [#1252](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1252) making sure a lot of Firefox internal data isn't included by default. You can still enable that with `--firefox.appconstants`.
  * New command `wait.bySelector(selector, maxTime)` implemented in [#1247](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1247).
  * Adding screenshots in scripting is a great feature and one thing that was missing was that the result JSON do not include any references to the screenshots, so tools that uses browsertime, didn't know that they exist. In sitespeed.ios case the screenshots are stored to disk but now shown. [#1245](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1245).
  * Automatically collect battery temperature for your Andorid phone. Collect start temperature (before you start to test your page) and stop temperature (when your test stopped) [#1250](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1250).
  * Use `--androidBatteryTemperatureLimit` to set a minimum battery temperature limit before you start your test on your Android phone. Temperature is in [Celsius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius). [#1253](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1253).

## 12.6.0 - 2020-04-21
### Added
* Updated to Browsertime 8.6.1 (from 8.5.0) and upgraded the main Docker container to use Ubuntu 20.04 and Python 3. Browsertime also includes [a couple of bug fixes](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#861---2020-04-16) when running Chrome on Android.

### Fixed
* Upgraded from AXE-core 3.5.1 to 3.5.3 in [#2955](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2955).
* If you run WebPageTest and Browsertime at the same time, both tools generates PageXray data that could cause wrong values as reported in [#2952](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2952), fixed in [#2954](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2954).

## 12.5.0 - 2020-04-08

### Fixed
* New coach that supports NodeJs 10 again.

### Added
* Send load time for LCP to Graphite/Influx so you can choose between render/start time and use max value in the HTML [#2940](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2940).

## 12.2.3 - 2020-03-20
### Fixed 
* Remove videoRecordingStart from the summary [#2935](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2935).
* Show CPU geckorprofile link only when you run Firefox [#2931](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2931).
* Upgraded to [Browsertime 8.3.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#830---2020-03-20).

## 12.2.2 - 2020-03-16

## 12.2.1 - 2020-03-16
### Fixed
* A little better error handling so if you run on latest NodeJS we catch if one of the HTML tasks fail and better watch for failing runs overall [#2927](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2927).
* Fixed the order when you remove a plugin so remove always win agains add. That means that you finally can remove lighthouse or gpsi when your run the plus1 container. Remove with `--plugins.remove /lighthouse` or  `--plugins.remove /gpsi`[#2926](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2926).

## 12.2.0 - 2020-03-15
### Added
* Updated the Docker container to use Firefox 74.
* Introduced a new slim container with only Firefox. Look for the version tag + slim `sitespeedio/sitespeed.io:12.2.0-slim`. The container is based on Buster slim and we try to keep it as small as possible. The test runs Firefox headless without XVFB and without FFMPeg/ImageMagick so no Visual Metrics in this container for now  [#2913](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2913).
* Cleaned up the dependency tree to make the container (and install) smaller on the default container [#2911](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2911).
* Use coach-core instead of coach [#2912](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2912).
* Use Browsertime 8.2.0 that removed the sharp dependency and instead uses jimp.
* The GPSI-plugin in the `plus1` container now uses the GPSI backend that uses Lighthouse. New structure of metrics so you will need to update your graphs. See [GPSI #20](https://github.com/sitespeedio/plugin-gpsi/pull/20). Also metrics is tagged by desktop/mobile [#2917](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2917) in Graphite/InfluxDB.
* Updated copy and show more total transfer sizes for transparency in the sustainable plugin, thank you Chris Adams [#2909](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2909), [#2919](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2919) and [#2920](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2920). Also updated co2.js to the newest version not using SQLite [#2922](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2922)

## 12.1.0 - 2020-03-03
### Added

* Add budget for first party number of requests and transfer/content size [#2872](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2872).
* The new sustainable web plugin developed together with Chris Adams of the Green Web Foundation. Main work in [#2868](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2868) and [#2899](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2899). Enable it with `--sustainable.enable`.

### Fixed
* Hide internal videoRecordingStart metric [#2883](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2883).
* --multi and crawl don't work together and before it was just silently ignored, now you get a message [#2889](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2889)
* The cli now verifies that you use NodeJS 10 or higher to run sitespeed.io [#2901](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2901), lower version don't work.

* Upgraded to Browsertime 7.8.0:
  * There's a new waot command in scripting `await commands.wait.byPageToComplete()` that waits for the configured page complete check to run. This is useful if you are running your own Selenium scripts and navigate through JavaScript and wants to wait for the page to finish loading [#1024](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1024).
  * Take a screenshot from a script `await commands.screenshot.take('name')`. The screenshot is stored on disk for that page and in later releases it will be included in the result JSON file [#1032](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1032).
  * A little safer check when getting the alias for page in scripting [#1031](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1031)

* Display First Input Delay and First Input Duration [#2812](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2812)

### Added
* Upgraded to Browsertime 7.4.2:
  * Collect number of DOM elements as a part of the page info for each run [#1000](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1000).
  * Configure how often to check for the pageCompleteCheck. Default is every 200 ms, and it happens after the load event end (using the default pageLoadStrategy). Set it with `--browsertime.pageCompleteCheckPollTimeout`(value in ms) [#998](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/998).
  * Added missing pageLoadStrategy option in the CLI. The option worked but no visible cli help for it [#1001](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1001).
  * Do not load the Browsertime WebExtention for Chrome (it is not used anymore) and make it possible for Firefox to disable to use it with `--browsertime.firefox.disableBrowsertimeExtension`.

  * Calculate FID instead of just report it [#1005](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1005)
  * You can now run ADB shell directly from your user script [#1007](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1007). Use `commands.android.shell('')`.
  * Add your own metrics from your script. The metrics will be in the result JSON and statistics will be calculated for that metric. Use `commands.measure.add(name, value)` or `commands.measure.addObject(object)` if you want to add multiple metrics. Documentation coming soon [#1011](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1011)
  * Remove and simplify old code when running with pageLoadStrategy none. Introducing `--pageCompleteCheckStartWait` - The time in ms to wait for running the page complete check for the first time. Use this when you have a pageLoadStrategy set to none. [#1008](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1008)
  * Better guards when calculating Visual Metrics [#1006](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/1006).

* The +1 container was updated to Lighthouse 5.6 + PR to make it possible to configure puppeteer [#39](https://github.com/sitespeedio/plugin-lighthouse/pull/39) so you don't need to run in headless mode.

### Fixed
* Show Long Tasks information in the HTML when you configure only Long Tasks (before you also needed the trace log) [#2802](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2802).
* Testing multiple URLs was broken for Lighthouse in the +1 container since 11.3.0. Fixed in [#43](https://github.com/sitespeedio/plugin-lighthouse/pull/43).

## 11.3.0 - 2019-11-22
### Added
* Added the sitespeed.io version and browser version in the title of the annotation tag of Graphite and Grafana [#2791](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2791), [#2792](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2792) and [#2793](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2793).

* The +1 container was missing the fixes to make it easier to turn of video and visual metrics when running the container [#2789](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2789)
* The WebPageTest Page Timing dashboard was missing the location field in the annotations (you could see both Firefox and Chrome runs even though you only choose on) and it was missing a line for render.
* Using `--mobile` together with WebPageReplay didn't respect the mobile settings, causing 404 for some URLs when testing Wikipedia on mobile [#2795](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2795).

## 11.2.0## - 2019-11-14

### Fixed
* The timestamp on the page summary was wrong: it showed when all tests started instead of the time of the first run as reported in [#2766](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2766) and fixed in [#2768](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2768).
* If uploading to S3 or GCS fails, the exit code will be an error and you can see that it failed in the HTML [#2774](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2774).
* A safer check when generating pages HTML page if something went wrong earlier in the run [#2778](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2778)

  * Added Contentful speed index is a new SI metric developed by Bas Schouten at Mozilla which uses edge detection to calculate the amount of "content" that is visible on each frame, thank you [dpalmeiro](https://github.com/dpalmeiro) for the PR [#976](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/976).
  * Firefox 67 and above has a built-in window recorder ([bug 1536174](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1536174)) that is able to dump PNG images of each frame that is painted to the window. This can be enabled and disabled in the browser console, or through the chrome context with selenium webdriver. This PR introduces a new privileged API that is able to execute JS in the chrome context, as well as support for generating a variable rate MP4 using the output images from the window recorder. The motivation for this work was to introduce a low-overhead video recorder that will not introduce performance disturbances during page loads. Thank you [dpalmeiro](https://github.com/dpalmeiro) for the PR [#978](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/978). You can try it out with `--video --firefox.windowRecorder`
  * There's a new way to set variance on your connectivity. At the moment you can only do that when you are using Throttle as engine. You can try it out with `--connectivity.variance 2` - that means the latency will have a variance of 2% between runs. Let us try this out and get back about later on [#973](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/973). Original idea from Emery Berger.
  * Some URLs failed because of that the document.title was an image, as reported in [#979](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/979) and fixed in [#980](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/980).
  * Hide sudo log when using Docker [#971](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/971).
  * Better log message if the Browser fails to start, thank you [Mason Malone](https://github.com/MasonM) for the PR [#962](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/962).

## 10.3.2 -  2019-10-18
### Fixed
* Changed the InfluxDB annotation log to log on debug level instead of info.
* The wrong HAR was viewed in the HTML result if you used `--html.fetchHARFiles` and tested multiple pages [#2704](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2704).
* If a pug template fail to render, log the template name and the data passed on [#2709](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2709)

## 10.3.1 -  2019-10-17
### Fixed
* If a page had a HTTP error, we logged all the requests, but we should only log the ones with a HTTP status code > 399. Fixed in [#2702](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2702)

## 10.3.0 -  2019-10-16
### Added
* Include filmstrip data (path to screenshots and metrics) in the HAR file [#2695](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2695)
* Your budget can now fail if you have any HTTP ERRORS on your page [#2691](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2691). Thank you [thapasya-m](https://github.com/thapasya-m) for the PR!
* Allow filtering run iteration metrics, thank you [Kevin Lakotko](https://github.com/kevinlacotaco) for the PR [#2697](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2697).
* Update indexed keys with names for user timing and asssets when you collect metric per iteration in Graphite. Thank you [Kevin Lakotko](https://github.com/kevinlacotaco) for the PR [#2701](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2701).
* New Browsertime with Geckodriver 0.26.0
* New Coach 4.1.0 that collect meta generator info.

## 10.2.0 - 2019-10-07
### Added
* Added stdev to metrics sent to InfluxDB [#2678](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2678).
* Simplify running Safari on ios devices by only using `--safari.ios` [#2666](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2666).
* Show ios device type in the HTML (iPhone/iPad) when you set the device type [#2667](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2667).
* [New and updated dashboards in Grafana](https://github.com/sitespeedio/grafana-bootstrap-docker) for Graphite/InfluxDB and for WebPageTest.
* Add a link to your result to compare with `--html.compareURL` [#2680](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2680).
* New PerfCascade with a button to easy copy response content [#2690](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2690).
* There's experimental suuport for sending data per run to Graphite `--graphite.experimental.perIteration`, thank you [Kevin Lakotko](https://github.com/kevinlacotaco) for the PR [#2679](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2679). This can change in the near future so only use it if you really know what you are doing :) Also as a normal user sending data to Graphite, you don't this functionallity, using pageSummary should be ebough.


### Fixed
* There was a bug that caused faulty docs for running axe. Use `--axe.enable`
to run Axe! [#2676](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2676).
* Set correct tag for CPU Long Tasks in InfluxDB [#2677](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2677)
* Handle float numbers in statistics, thank you [tengremlin](https://github.com/tengremlin) for the PR [#2675](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2675).
* Upgraded to Yargs 14.2.0 that fixes so you can extend config.json files in multiple steps. Before only on step worked.
* Upgraded to Browsertime [6.1.3](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#browsertime-changelog) that fixes the TSProxy bug.
* Testing localhost broke the third party plugins. Fixed in the new Coach and in sitespeed.io [#2689](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2689).
* Upgraded to the Coach 4.0.2.

## 10.1.1 - 2019-10-01
### Fixed
* Fix so that if we have the filmstrip from the Chrome trace log, those images should be used in the filmstrip view [#2661](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2661)
* Fix resultBaseURL as env variable as reported by MasonM in [#2663](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2663) fixed in [#2664](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2664).
* Upgraded to Browsertime 6.1.1 that fixes SpeedLine visual metrics to numbers instead of strings.

## 10.1.0 - 2019-09-25
### Added
* WebPageTest: send standard deviation for some of the timing metrics by default [#2656](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2656).
* Updated Browsertime to 6.1.0:
  * Get the first input in Chrome (useful for user journeys) [#948](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/948).
  * Removed settings for enabling LayoutInstabilityAPI in Chrome (is on by default in Chrome 77) [#949](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/949.
  * Fixed a bug for Chrome when you couldn't send more that one request header [#950](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/950).
  * Empty long task after you collect them.
* Updated dashboards: New WebPageTest dashboard showing standartd deviation: https://github.com/sitespeedio/grafana-bootstrap-docker/blob/master/dashboards/graphite/WebPageTestDeviation.json and updated page timing metrics dashboard for sitespeed.io so you can just use the drowdown to see the standard deviation for different metrics https://github.com/sitespeedio/grafana-bootstrap-docker/blob/master/dashboards/graphite/PageTimingMetrics.json

##  10.0.3 - 2019-09-24
### Fixed
* Updated to Browsertime 6.0.4
  * Upgraded TSProxy to 1.5 [#945](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/945) see [TSProxy issue #20](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/tsproxy/issues/20) for more details.
  * Upgraded to latest Chrome-har with extra guard if a response is missing respone data.
* Fix so --script can take a directory as input as Browsertime [#2651](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2651). Thank you [Sumeet Rohra](https://github.com/sumeetrohra) for the PR.
* Removed the alias --connectivity for -c because it broke the configuration JSON [#2649](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2649)
* Running WebPageReplay using --mobile used to record in desktop size and replay in mobile. That is fixed now in [#2654](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2654)
* InfluxDB and Grafana used wrong tags in annotations if you used WebPageTest. Fixed in [#2644](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2644)

##  10.0.2 - 2019-09-14
### Fixed
* Removed the fast-crc32c dependency for the GCS plugin to make sitespeed.io work on NodeJS 12 [#2634](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2634). Thank you [Radu Micu](https://github.com/radum) for the PR!

* Updated to Browsertime 6.0.3 that fixes broken proxy handling, flicker of the timer in the video, and Chrome trace log problems that missed responses.

### Tech
* Small refactor of code [#2641](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2641) and [#2639](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2639) thank you [Sumeet Rohra](https://github.com/sumeetrohra).

## 10.0.1 - 2019-09-12
### Fixed
* Updated Browsetime with stable ChromeDriver (instead of beta), do not show First Paint for Safari, and fixing getting long task data if you first navigate and then measure a URL. See the [Browsertime changelog](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#601---2019-09-12) for all the info.

## 10.0.0 - 2019-09-11
### Added
* Updated to Firefox 69 and Chrome 77 in the Docker container.
* Collext Axe violations for summary and detailed summary [#2622](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2622). Read more in the [documentation](https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/axe/).
* Added new metrics for slacking errors/warnings: firstPaint, visualComplete85, lastVisualChange, fullyLoaded (and fixed broken fullyLoaded) [#2611](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2611).
* Show the top 20 largest assets on the PageXray tab [#2583](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2583)
* Show the transfer size of assets (not only content size) in the toplists in the HTML [#2560](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2560)
* You can now test your pages using Axe: `--axe.enable` - The test will run after all other metrics are collected and will add some extra time to your total run test time [#2571](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2571). You can see all axe information in the new tab.
* Limited support for using Safari. You need Catalina + iOS 13 to run Safari on your phone/tablet. Read more in the [documentation](https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/browsers/#safari).
* Send FirstMeaningfulPaint by default to Graphite/InfluxDb [#2559](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2559)
* [Updated dashboards](https://github.com/sitespeedio/grafana-bootstrap-docker) with a new annotation (for sitespeed.io changes) and fixed WebPageTest dashboards to work with annotations.
* Upgraded to [Browsertime 6.0.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
  * Upgraded to Ubuntu Disco in the Docker container [#908](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/908).
  * Use [TSProxy](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/tsproxy) to throttle the connection. You should use TSProxy when you run on Kubernetes. Use it by `--connectivity.engine tsproxy`. We used to have support years ago but it never worked good on Mac/Linux so we dropped it. But it works now so we added it back [#891](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/891).
  * You can now add your own metrics directly from your script (or post script) using *context.result.extras*. More info coming [#917](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/917)
  And some new things coming in Chrome:
  * Using Chrome 77 (or later) you will now get a layout shift score (in percentage), see https://web.dev/layout-instability-api. [#905](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/905).
  * Get LargestContentfulPaint in Chrome 77 (or later) [#906](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/906).
  * Get ElementTimings in Chrome 77 (or later) [#921](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/921). All elements needs to have a unique identifier for this to work correctly.
  * There's an alternative to collect Visual Metrics using the Chrome trace log, using [SpeedLine](https://github.com/paulirish/speedline) implemented in [#876](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/876). Using video give more accurate metrics (at least in our testing) but maybe it could help running on Chrome on Android and add less overhead than recording a video. You can enable it with:  `--cpu --chrome.visualMetricsUsingTrace --chrome.enableTraceScreenshots`

### Fixed
* Guard against broken WPT multi-step runs [#2621](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2621).
* Multiple bug fixes for the Slack plugin: Show the correct connectivity, always have a red color when we have an error and fixed bug when comparing metrics (we compare with median) [#2610](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2610).
* Only using number as an alias for connectivity should be ok [#2612](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2612).
* Unified how to log the options object, so that Browsertime and sitespeed.io follow the same standard. You can now log your options/configuration with `--verbose` that is super helpful when you need to debug configuration issues [#2588](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2588).
* Sending metrics to InfluxDB was broken because of a bug in how we get the connectivity name. Fixed in [#2587](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2587).
* HTML fix for showing the script in the result HTML [#2597](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2597).
* Running a script, testing multiple different domains, having aliases made data in Graphite sent under the wrong group/domain. Fixed in [#25###92](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2592)
* Fixed annotations tag when using WebPageTest. Before the correct values was not sent. With the fix you can use the annotations on you WebPageTest dashboard [2602](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2602).
* Add WebPageTest screenshot in annotation if you use WebPageTest without Browsertime [#2603](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2603) and [#2605](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2605)
* Link to WebPageTest HAR in the annotation if you run WebPageTest standalone [#2609](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2609).

### Changed
* Upgraded to yargs 14.1.0 that deep merge configuration files when you extend another configuration [#2626](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2626)
* To store the log to file you need to now add `--logToFile` to your run. This makes sense that you need to make an active choice to store the log file[#2606](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2606).
* Using `--debug`now set the log level to verbose instead of just logging the message queue. To log the message queue use `--debugMessages` [#2607](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2607).

### Tech
* Updated dev dependencies and yargs, @google-cloud/storage, aws-sdk, dayjs, findup, fs-extra, influx, juni-report-builder, p-limit, pug, simplecrawler and tape.

##  9.8.1 - 2019-08-03
### Fixed
* Upgraded to Browsertime 5.7.3 that fixes a bug introduced in Browsertime 5.6.0 (sitespeed.io 9.7.0) that made it impossible to set multiple cookies when using Chrome [#910](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/910).

##  9.8.0 - 2019-08-01

### Added
* We updated the Docker container to use Chrome 76 and swicthed to ChromeDriver 76. We had some issues with Chrome 76 (or ChromeDriver) that increased number of times we got errors converting the Chrome trace log because of missing navigationStart events (see [#902](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/902)) on our test servers. But that seems fixed with [#904](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/904).

## 9.7.0 - 2019-07-29

In this release we moved functionality for Chrome from our [browser extension](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime-extension) to the devtools protocol instead, so that the same functionality also works in Chrome on Android. Read the [changelog for Browsertime for all changes](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#560----2019-07-27).

### Fixed
* You can now use `--android` to run tests on Android phones (the same way as on Browsertime) [#2544](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2544).

### Added
* Upgraded to third-party-web 0.10.1.
* Upgraded to Browsertime [5.6.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#560----2019-07-27) and [5.6.1](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#561----2019-07-28).

##  9.6.0 - 2019-07-11
### Added
* Docker container is now using Firefox 68.

### Fixed
* Upgrading to Browsertime 5.5 that catches broken timeToFirstInteractive in Firefox (we've seen it reported -46 years, if that happens we report 0 instead).

## 9.5.0 - 2019-07-04
### Fixed
* Better error message if the config JSON is malformed [#2525](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2525).
* Updated Browsertime with a new version of Tracium that adds another way of finding Navigation start.
* Better error handling for WebPageTest: Make sure we always log error from the WebPageTest API, added guards for when WebPageTest fails and always log the full URL to the result on WebPageTest [#2527](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2527).
* Better error message if the WebPageTest server timeouts [#2529](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2529)

### Added
* If you use WebPageTest standalone, we will include a link in the Graphite/Grafana/InfluxDB annotation to the WebPageTest result on the WebPageTest server [#2528](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2528). In the future we should make sure we include a link if we run both Browsertime and WebPageTest.
* Updated to Browsertime 5.4.1:
  * Better check that a request header is supplied before parsing [#875](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/875).
  * Better error message for the user if the config.json file is malformed [#869](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/869)
  * Getting the netlog for Chrome was broken when using scripting. This fix catches an error and changes when we remove the file. If you test multiple URLs the netlog will contain all interactions for the script. The first file = first URL. The second file = first and second url. [#874](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/874)
  * Two new functions in scripting: `addText.byName(text, name)` and `addText.byClassName(text, className)`. See [#870](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/870).
  * Upgraded to coming Selenium 4. There should be no difference for end users [#871](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/871).

## 9.4.0 - 2019-06-29
### Added
* Upgraded to [Browsertime 3.4.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#530---2019-06-29) with the following fixes:
  * Added support for `--injectJs` using Chrome [#864](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/864).
  * Use CDP to set request headers for Chrome (instead of the Browsertime extension). This enables adding extra headers for Chrome on Android and fixes [#2520](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2520). Fixed in [#867](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/867).
* Report JS heap size by deafult for Chrome to Graphite/InfluxDb [#2524](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2524)

## 9.3.4 - 2019-06-20
### Fixed
* Tabs on mobile in the HTML was broken and some tables wasn't displayed correctly [#2511](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2511)
* Added extra check that we really have 3rd party data when displaying CPU metrics.
* Fixed extra error when WebPageTest test failed and we still tried to get the trace log.

## 9.3.3 - 2019-06-16
### Fixed
* Upgraded to Browsertime 5.2.6:
  * Catch if getting the HTML for a resource from Chrome fails [#861](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/861).
  * A couple of more pixels to know if a orange screen is orange in Visual Metrics [#862](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/862).
  * Bumped versions if adbkit, chrome-remote-interface & yargs [#863](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/863).

# 9.3.2 - 2019-06-13

### Fixed
* Moved the download Chrome trace button to the top of the page so we can find it [#2505](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2505).
* Upgraded to Browsertime 5.2.5 that fixes:
  * Fixed so that the tracing in Chrome ends before we start to run our JavaScript metrics (so that they aren't picked up in the trace) [#860](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/860).
  * Running a script that started to measure without a URL and used an alias instead missed out on starting some browser services, for example Long Tasks in Chrome was not recorded. That is fixed in [#858](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/858)
* Fixed broken pug in the GPSI plugin.

## 9.3.1 - 2019-06-12

### Fixed
* Make sure the HTML plugin doesn't break if the +1 GPSI plugin doesn't return any data.
* Upgraded Browsertime 5.2.2 that uses a fixed version of Tracium that doesn't throw errors if the trace log from Chrome isn't the way Tracium wants it. This helps us getting trace log from multiple sites and user journeys.
* If testing a URL failed for Chrome, and you wanted CPU metrics, the HTML report failed. Fixed in [#2504](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2504)
* Upgraded to Third Party Web 0.9.0.

## 9.3.0 - 2019-06-10

## Added
* Upgraded to Chrome 75 and Firefox 67.0.1 in the Docker container.
* Upgraded to use ChromeDriver 75.
* Upgraded the Coach that also uses latest Chrome and ChromeDriver.
* New Browsertime:
  * Added metric LastMeaningfulPaint that will be there when you collect `--visualElements` [848](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/848).
  * You can get screenshots in your Chrome trace log using `--chrome.enableTraceScreenshots` [#851](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/851)
  * Fixed the missing timings in the trace log in Chrome. Or rather they where there but you couldn't see them when you drag/drop the log into devtools [#850](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/850).
  * Next version of Chrome (76) brings back the infobar that pushes down content see [upstream](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=818483). Lets remove the automated flag and test how that works [#853](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/853).
  * Include the last 50 pixels when checking if the page is still orange, hopefully fixing the case where First Visual Change happens way too early [#854](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/854).
* The +1 container uses Lighthouse 5.1.

### Fixed
* Only parse the domain in the third party plugin if we have a absolute URL [#2501](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2501).
* Handle if GPSI doesn't return page statistics [#2499](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2499).

## 9.2.1 - 2019-06-01
### Fixed
* `--help` was broken in 9.2.0.

## 9.2.0 - 2019-06-01

### Added
* The config file `--config` now supports extending other config files. Read [yargs documentation](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/master/docs/api.md#extends-keyword) for how to use the extends keyword. Add `"extends":"/default.json"` to extend your config file named *default.json* file. One thing: The configuration files are merged and the extended ones keys are overriden if they exist in your configuration. This is upstream thing but maybe we can fix that in the future.

### Fixed
* Updated Browsertime to 5.1.3 that goes back to use default Selenium 3.6 (without CDP supports) and with CDP support implemented on the side. Also updated Coach with the latest Browsertime.


## 9.1.0 - 2019-05-30

### Added
* Upgraded to Firefox 67.0 in the Docker container.
* Upgraded to 0.8.2 of third-party-web
* Upgraded Browsertime that automatically pickup up visual metrics for elements with the elementtiming attribute. When it land in Chrome, this will make sure you will get it both in RUM and synthetic [#841](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/841).
* Send CPU metrics as summmary per domain to Graphite/InfluxDB [#2480](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2480)
* You can now see number of CPU long tasks on the summary page [#2479](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2479)
* Upgraded to latest Perf Cascade thagt shows HAR content in new tab [#2478](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2478)
* Show Visual Metrics defined by the user on metrics page [#2476](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2476)
* WebPageTest: Send hero timings to Graphite/InfluxDB by default [#2474](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2474)
* The new [performance leaderboard](https://dashboard.sitespeed.io/d/000000060/leaderboard?orgId=1)

### Fixed
* Upgraded the Coach with a bug fix that make sure a JavaScript loaded as defer isn't categorised as render blocking. Also the new version give known surveillance web sites lower score in privacy.
* Third party web sites (sites that themselves are third parties) counted all there own requests as third parties [#2475](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2475).
* Getting the HTML content into your Chrome HAR included the full content object instead of just the plain text. Fixed in [#842](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/842).
Using CPU metrics on Android phones was broken since 9.0.0, fixed in [#844](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/844).

## 9.0.0 - 2019-05-21

### Added
* Upgraded to [Browsertime 5.0.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500---2019-05-16).

* Collect CPU long tasks in Chrome using `--chrome.collectLongTasks` using the [Long Task API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Long_Tasks_API). For the long tasks to work, we inject JS using the *Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument* devtools command. We collect all long tasks and related data (not so much at the moment but will get better/more useful information when browsers supports it) and count the total number of long tasks, long tasks that happens before first paint and first contentful paint. Implemented in [#821](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/821) and [#825](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/825).

* By default a long task is >50ms. Wanna change that? Use `--minLongTaskLength` to set that yourselves (it needs to be larger than 50 ms though) [#838](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/838).

* Throttle the CPU using Chrome with `--chrome.CPUThrottlingRate`. Enables CPU throttling to emulate slow CPUs. Throttling rate as a slowdown factor (1 is no throttle, 2 is 2x slowdown, etc). Implemented in [#819](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/819).

* You can now use a .browsertime.json file as a default config json file that will be picked up automatically [#824](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/824).

* Include the actual HTML in the HAR file for Chrome using `--chrome.includeResponseBodies html` [#826](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/826)

* Use `--chrome.blockDomainsExcept` to block all domains except. Use it muliple times to have multiple domains. You can also use wildcard like *.sitespeed.io [#840](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/840)

* You can use a `.siteespeed.io.json` file that holds default config setup when you run sitespeed.io [#2454](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2454).

* We have moved all CPU metrics to a new tab called ... wait a minute .. CPU! [#2457](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2457).

* If you use Chrome you can use `--cpu` to enable  to enable `--chrome.timeline` and `--chrome.collectLongTasks` in one go [#2457](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2457).

* The film strip includes CPU long tasks [#2459](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2459)

### Changed
* Replaced [Chrome-trace](https://github.com/sitespeedio/chrome-trace) with [Tracium](https://github.com/aslushnikov/tracium) in [#816](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/816/). This means we use a Chrome blessed parser that will mean less work for us within the team! Enable it with `--chrome.timeline`. It also means two changes:
* We skipped reporting all internal events inside of Chrome and only report events that takes more than 10 ms. We do this because it makes it easier to understand which events actually takes time and are useful.
* Instead of reporting: Loading, Painting, Rendering, Scripting and Other we now report the same categories as Tracium: parseHTML, styleLayout, paintCompositeRender, scriptParseCompile,  scriptEvaluation, garbageCollection and other. This gives you a little more insights of CPU time spent.
* We collect more trace log than before (following Lighthouse, the trace log will be larger on disk), this makes it easier for you when you want to debug problems.

* Lighthouse: If you use the G+ container, Lighthouse has changed: The container uses Lighthouse 5.0, output HTML by default that is iframed into sitespeed.io. That means instead of seeing just the cherry picked metrics, you will now see the full Lighthouse result. See [#26](https://github.com/sitespeedio/plugin-lighthouse/pull/26).

* On the summary page, we show Third party summary from the median run instead of actual median metrics. That makes it one less click to see which 3rd party tools a web page is using [#2455](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2455).

* Remember when you upgrade there are two things that can change: Metrics could be a little slower in Chrome since we now collect more trace log (only when you turn on CPU tracing) and there are new categoris for the CPU trace! If you use Lighthouse and had your own hack for including the HTML, that isn't needed any more.

### Fixed
* Bumped all dependenciesÂ that needed a bump [#2453](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2453).

## 8.15.2 - 2019-05-05
### Fixed
* Upgraded Firefox to 66.0.4 to fix the issue that broke Firefox extension (making it impossible to get the HAR file etc).

## 8.15.1 - 2019-04-26
### Fixed
* Various bug fixes for GSC plugin, thank you [Markus Liljedahl](https://github.com/mliljedahl) for the PR [#2438](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2438).

## 8.15.0 - 2019-04-23
### Added
* Use Chrome 74 stable in the Docker container and Chomedriver 74 (you need upgrade to Chrome 74).
* Upgraded Coach to match latest Browsertime version with Chrome and upgraded Browsertime to fix miss matched locked file in npm for ChromeDriver.

### Fixed
* We displayed error on the summary page even though we didn't have an error.

## 8.14.0 - 2019-04-23

### Added
* Collect errors from Browsertime and send them to Graphite/InfluxDB. This makes it possible to alert on failing runs in Grafana [#2429](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2429). The metrics are sent under the key *browsertime.statistics.errors*.

* The GPSI in the g+ container was upgraded to gpagespeed 6.0.6.

* Upgraded to third-party-web 0.6.1 that includes more domains.

* Upgrading to [Browsertime 4.7.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#470---2019-04-21) adds three new things to scripting:
  * You can add your own error `commands.error(message)`. The error will be attached to the latest tested page. Say that you have a script where you first measure a page and then want to click on a specific link and the link doesn't exist. Then you can attach your own error with your own error text. The error will be sent to your datasource and will be visible in the HTML result.

  * You can add meta data to your script with `commands.meta.setTitle(title)` and `commands.meta.setDescription(desc)`

* Upgrading to [Browsertime 4.8.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#480---2019-04-23) fixes so errors thrown from your script, holds a usable error message instead of the wrapped ChromeDriver error.

### Fixed
* If a page failed, pug through an error [#2428](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2428)

* The close (and open methods) of plugins missed waiting on all plugins before moving on as reported in [2431](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2431) and [#2433](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2433) and fixed in [#2434](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2434).


## 8.13.0 - 2019-04-17

### Added
* Show the total number of third party requests and also add them as a column on the pages page [#2422](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2422).

### Fixed
* Better error handling if one URL fails in a script by upgrading to Browsertime 4.6.4 and PageXray 2.5.6.

## 8.12.0 - 2019-04-11

### Added
* We updated Chrome to version 74 beta in the Docker container. The reason is that some users had problem running Chrome 73 in the container. You can read all about it in [#2416](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2416). Most metrics looks the same. One thing we've seen is that there is a new event "RunTask" that is categorised as "Other" if you use `--chrome.timeline`. We will fix that later on, just a heads up! Updated in [#2419](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2419).

### Fixed

## 8.11.2 - 2019-04-10

### Fixed
* Added missing User Timing measure duration in the HTML output. We have always collected that but we didn't show it in the HTML [#2417](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2417).

## 8.11.1 - 2019-04-09

### Fixed
* Upgraded to Grafana 6.1.3 in the Docker compose file.
* Ugraded to Browsertime 4.6.2 that fixes Report duration metrics in CDP performance in ms.

## 8.11.0 - 2019-04-08

### Added
* Upgraded to [Browsertime 4.6.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#460---2019-04-07) that enables the use of [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). We now uses a modified version of Selenium that can use CDP. We also automatically collect the CDP performance metrics *Performance.getMetrics* (you can turn that off with `--chrome.cdp.performance false`). We also enabled raw use of the CDP in scripting: `cdp.sendAndGet(command, args)` and `cdp.send(command, args)` [#2410](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2410).

* Show loadEventEnd in the metrics section and send it to Graphite/Grafana [#2411](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2411).

* Upgraded third-party-web to 0.4.0 with almost 2000 new entities! Thank you [Simon Hearne](https://twitter.com/simonhearne) for that massive update.

* The Lighthouse plugin can now generate the default HTML report [#18](https://github.com/sitespeedio/plugin-lighthouse/pull/18), thanks [Semyon](https://github.com/SemyonLosmakov) for the PR.

### Fix

* Updated version of PerfCascade that catches if timings in the HAR is missing, hopefully partly fixing [#2408](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2408).

## 8.10.1 - 2019-04-06

### Fixed
* Upgraded to PageXray 2.5.5 that fixes that the total number of requests was reported wrong for Firefox in some cases as reported in [#2409](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2409).

## 8.10.0 - 2019-04-02

### Added
* Tag unmatched 3rd party request as unknown, that adds a category to keep track of in Graphite/Grafana [#2405](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2405)

* List all unmatched third party domains on the third party pages to make it easier to catch unmatched third parties [#2404](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2404).

* Updated the third-party-web project to 0.2.0 with more domains that get categorised.

## 8.9.0 - 2019-03-30

### Added

- Browsertime supports connectivity.alias option to give connectivity profiles a custom name, though this is not documented in the Sitespeed cli help, and not consistently used in Sitespeed. (only used for writing to DB, but not in reports). This PR adds option to sitespeed cli and uses the alias in html reports [#2397](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2397). Thank you [Ferdinand Holzer](https://github.com/fholzer) for the PR.

- Reworked third party support: There's a new third party tab where we use [Patrick Hulce](https://github.com/patrickhulce) project [Third party web](https://github.com/patrickhulce/third-party-web) to categorise third party requests [#2394](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2394). Requests get categorised and you can now see how many requests each category do (ads/analytics/sureillance etc). And also how many tools the page uses per type. These numbers are also automatically sent to Graphite/InfluxDB so you easily can create alerts if your content team adds third party content that you don't want.

### Fixed

- Using `--useHash` was broken (it was not populated to Browsertime). Fixed [#2393](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2393).

- URLs in annotations where broken if your page used # as reported by [James Leatherman](https://github.com/leathej1) in [#2400](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2400).

## 8.8.3 - 2019-03-25

### Fixed

- Upgraded to Browsertime 4.5.3 that fixes so that you can test the same URLs within the same script. There are users that logs in and logs out the user on the same URL and that breakes since we use the URL to create all the files for that URL. This hack adds a incremental query parameter to the URL.[#805](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/805).

## 8.8.2 - 2019-03-22

### Fixed

- Upgraded Browsertime to 4.5.2 that adds logging if Visual Metrics fails, to make it easier for us to get better feedback for users. If you add `--verbose` to your run, the output from Visual Metrics will be logged.

## 8.8.1 - 2019-03-22

### Fixed

- Upgraded Browsertime to 4.5.1 that fixes the bug when recording visual metrics and clicking on links on Android phones.

## 8.8.0 - 2019-03-21

### Added

- Upgraded to Chrome 73 in the Docker container.
- Upgraded to Firefox 66 in the Docker container
- Added favicon, json, plain, svg and other and budget types. Thanks [PedroMSantosD](https://github.com/PedroMSantosD) for the PR [#2374](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2374).
- The plus1 container now includes Lighthouse 4.2.0
- You can now debug log Lighthouse using `--verbose` , thank you [Gideon Pyzer](https://github.com/gidztech) for the original PR.
- New metrics for Firefox in stable (66): First contentful paint and time to first interactive. They are automatically sent to Graphite/InfluxDB. To make sure you catch that timeToFirstInteractive you may wanna change your page complete check to: `--pageCompleteCheck "return (function(waitTime) { if (window.performance.timing.timeToFirstInteractive > 0) { try { var end = window.performance.timing.loadEventEnd; return end > 0 && Date.now() > end + waitTime; } catch (e) { return true; } } else return false; })(arguments[arguments.length - 1]);"` - these are experimental metrics behind a flag in Firefox.

### Fixed

- Fixed broken disabling of screenshots [#2378](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2378)

## 8.7.5 - 2019-03-13

### Fixed

- Upgrading Browsertime to 4.4.9 with two fixes:
  - Automatically catch if a user that uses a script misses calling measure.stop() [#798](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/798).
  - If a runs fail, make sure Browsertime fails more gracefully [#799](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/799).

## 8.7.4 - 2019-03-12

### Fixed

- In some cases alias wasn't picked up for URLs sent to Graphite/InfluxDB as reported in [#2341](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2341) and fixed in [#2373](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2373). Thank you [James Leatherman](https://github.com/leathej1) for taking the time to find a reproducible test case!
- Moved to internal UTC support in dayjs [#2370](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2370).

## 8.7.3 - 2019-03-07

### Fixed

- Fix for getting the GCS to work [#2368](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2368).

## 8.7.2 - 2019-03-07

### Fixed

- Added back the HTML folder for assets that was faulty excluded from git.

## 8.7.1 - 2019-03-07

### Fixed

- Fixed error log from chmod in the Docker container with a better check for if the extra start script exists.

## 8.7.0 - 2019-03-06

### Added

- Support for uploading result to Google Cloud Storage. Thank you [Markus Liljedahl](https://github.com/mliljedahl) for the PR [#2360](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2360)!
- Set where to serve your assets with `--html.assetsBaseURL`. This is useful if you want to minimize the data stored and store the assets (JS/CSS/Images) on the side of your result folder. Thank you [Ferdinand Holzer](https://github.com/fholzer) for the PR [#2321](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2321)
- Set your own annotation title [#2333](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2333), thank you [Markus Liljedahl](https://github.com/mliljedahl) for the PR.
- Added HTML link in the Coach result from each advice type to individual advice [#2344](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2344)
- Make it easy to use pageLoadTime in the new budget format [#2351](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2351).
- You can now run your extra start script in the Docker container: `docker run -e EXTRA_START_SCRIPT=/sitespeed.io/test.sh --rm -v "$(pwd)":/sitespeed.io ...`. Thank you [Gideon Pyzer](https://github.com/gidztech) for the initial idea and version! See [#2363](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2363).

### Fixed

- Upgraded to PageXray 2.5.4 that categorise first party using the actual domain instead of the full URL (as reported by [arunthilak](https://github.com/arunthilak)).
- Upgraded to [Browsertime 4.4.8](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#448---2019-03-04).
- Lighthouse audit tag for InfluxDB, thank you [Semyon](https://github.com/SemyonLosmakov) for the PR [#2359](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2359)
- Changed the unused message gc.finished to gcs.finished to work with comming Google Cloud Storage support [#2362](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2362)

## 8.6.5 - 2019-02-28

### Fixed

- [Gideon Pyzer](https://github.com/gidztech) fixed the broken config parameter for Lighthouse (if you use the Lighthouse container) in [#10](https://github.com/sitespeedio/plugin-lighthouse/pull/10).

## 8.6.4 - 2019-02-24

### Fixed

- When sending annotations with `--graphite.annotationMessage` and not providing a screenshot the message and the extraMessage used to get concatenated without any space. Thank you [Markus Liljedahl](https://github.com/mliljedahl) for the PR [#2332](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2332) that fixes that.

- Better error messages when sending data to Grafana. Thank you again [Markus Liljedahl](https://github.com/mliljedahl) [#2334](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2334).

- Waterfall chart had colliding texts, the font is now slightly smaller [#2345](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2345).

## 8.6.3 - 2019-02-21

### Fixed

- Upgraded to Browsertime 4.4.7 with fix for better finding last visual change in the video.

## 8.6.2 - 2019-02-20

### Fixed

- Upgraded to Browsertime 4.4.6 that adds better error handling if your multi script is broken or if a URL fails to load.

## 8.6.1 - 2019-02-19

### Fixed

- Upgraded to Browsertime 4.4.5 that changed so that 0.05% of the pixels could differ (instead of 0.01%) when finding the last visual change.

- Removed the Chrome specific setup in Chrome that was needed a long time ago [#2322](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2322)

## 8.6.0 - 2019-02-17

### Fixed

- Show larger screenshots in filmstrip for mobile, fixing colliding metrics HTML and last screenshot showing twice [#2314](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2314).
- Fix wrong count for errors/warnings for console log send to Graphite/InfluxDB. Before we sent 1 instead of the actual number of logs per page [#2316](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2316).
- Fix coach table colouring. Thank you [Ferdinand Holzer](https://github.com/fholzer) for the PR [#2317](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2317)!
- Removed [faulty guard](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/commit/df3313540671406e570dbea30b909b8f0f22e75f) in budget that made sure only internal metrics worked for Lighthouse/GPSI/WebPageTest.

- New Browsertime versions that fixes:
  - If a Visual Element wasn't found, we used to log that as an error, instead log as info [#775](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/775).
  - When trying to find the last visual change, a 0.01 % difference in pixels are now OK. We had problems finding too small difference that was picked up by Visual Metrics [#774](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/774).

### Added

- Send console warnings by default to Graphite/InfluxDB per page (we used to only send errors by default) [#2315]-(https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2315).

- Support for crawler exclude pattern, use `--crawler.exclude`. Thank you [Ferdinand Holzer](https://github.com/fholzer) for the PR [#2319](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2319).

## 8.5.1 - 2019-02-14

### Fixed

- Upgraded to Browsertime 4.4.2 that fixes the flickering of the timer in the video.

## 8.5.0 - 2019-02-13

### Added

- Support Lighthouse, WebPageTest or GPSI in the new budget format. See https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/performance-budget/#full-example

### Fixed

- The produced budget JUnit file had an error reported [here](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2307#issuecomment-463147211) and fixed in [#2311](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2311)

- Added extra guard when chrome.timeline data is missing, so that the HTML will not break issue [#2310](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2310) and [fixed](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/commit/427d28f7119327cdbc06bc51700d2b8488e472f8).

- Browsertime 4.4.1 with a fix so that the timings in the video correctly match what happens on the screen.

## 8.4.0 - 2019-02-12

### Added

- Give your test a name with `--name` [#2302](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2302). At the moment only used in the HTML.

- Upgraded to Browsertime [4.4.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#440---2019-02-12):
  - There are two new cache clear commands: cache.clearKeepCookies() and cache.clear() (only working on Desktop) [#769](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/769).
  - Updated RUM Speed Index to include upstream fix [#766](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/766).
  - Make sure the body of the page is shown when setting the fullscreen to orange (when recording the video) [#767](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/767)
  - Testing redirect URLs was broken since 8.0. If you test a URL, use that URL and if you click on a link, use the URL from the browser [#768](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/768). If you where testing a URL that redirected and did't give it an alias, your key in Graphite/InfluxDB will change (back to as it was pre 8.0).

### Fixed

- Catch errors when creating the filmstrip, so that not the full test fails.
- Analysisstorer gives error when using script as reported in [#2305](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2305) and fixed in [#2306](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2306).

## 8.3.0 - 2019-02-10

### Added

- Use alias from the script when displaying URLs in the HTML, reported by [banuady](https://github.com/banuady) in [#2296](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2296) and fixed in [#2297](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2297).

- You can include the script your using in the HTML output with `--html.showScript` [#2298](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2298). Be careful though with passwords or other secrets.

- Added json as output type for the budget. Set `--budget.output json` and it will store _budgetResult.json_ in your result directory [#2299](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2299).

- Upgraded to Browsertime [4.3.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#430-2019-02-10) with new addText.bySelector(text, selector) command + fixed so click.byJs and click.byJsAndWait works on elements that is hidden.

- Added endpoint to s3 configurations to allow for pushing HTML reports to Digital Ocean's Spaces as it is S3 compatible. [#2072]

### Fixed

- Upgraded to Browsertime [4.2.6](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#426-2019-02-08) with two fixes:
  - Command set value by id was broken, it used to set the value to the id [#761](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/761).
  - I've missed that for some URLs (as in this [login](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2290#issuecomment-461601990) you could have an alias for an URL but the URL was actually slightly different. For example, you login to a site and the login step redirect to a URL and for that URL one value of a GET parameter differs. So with this fix we lock the alias tyo one specific URL. If your URL change and you use an alias, the first variation of the URL will be used [#763](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/763).
- Spelling for the script-reader message (was scrtipt-reader).

## 8.2.3 2019-02-06

### Fixed

- Upgraded to Browsertime [4.2.5](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#425---2019-02-06) that hopefully fixes the wrong metrics inserted into the HAR file if you run test multiple pages.

## 8.2.2 2019-02-05

### Fixed

- Warn in the log if you try to run a script without a --multi parameter [#2288](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2288).

## 8.2.1 2019-02-04

### Fixed

- New Browsertime [4.2.4](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#424---2019-02-04) with fixed bug for commands set.innerHtml and click.byXpath.

## 8.2.0 2019-02-04

### Added

- New Browsertime [4.2.3](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) with:
  - Fixed so that `js.run()` returns whatever it gets back so you can script and get whatever you need from your page [#749](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/749).
  - New help command **set** to set innerHtml, innerText and value of element. [#750](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/750).
  - Added click.bySelector and rewrote most of click methods to use plain JavaScript instead of Selenium (so it will work on hidden elements) [#751](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/751).
  - The HAR file had wrong visual metrics as reported in [#754](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/754). Fixed in [#756](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/756).
  - Fixed borders when running Visual Metrics to try to avoid small orange in the first frame for Chrome [#755](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/755) fixed in [#757](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/757).
- Added endpoint as an configurable argument for s3 options, making it possible to use Digital Ocean for storage (and others)[#2285](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2285)

## 8.1.1 - 2019-02-01

### Fixed

- Updated Coach to use latest Browsertime

## 8.1.0 - 2019-02-01

### Added

- New tab showing the filmstrip (if you record a video and keep the screenshots). We had the screenshots forever but never done anything with them. Inspired by [Stefan Burnickis](https://github.com/sburnicki) work on https://github.com/iteratec/wpt-filmstrip [#2274](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2274).
- Show Server Timings in the metric section (if the page uses Server Timing) [#2277](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2277).
- Upgraded the Docker container to use Chrome 72 and Firefox 65.
- Upgraded to [Browsertime 4.1](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#410---2019-01-31) with latest ChromeDriver and Geckodriver. There's also a new command `js.runAndWait('')` that makes it possible to run your own JavaScript, click a link and wait on page navigation.

### Fixed

- Show FullyLoaded instead of N/A on metric pages per run [#2278](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2278).
- Added missing pre/post script in the CLI (thanks Cheng Chi!) [#2282](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2282).

## 8.0.6 - 2019-01-28

### Fixed

- Bugfix: In Browsertime 4.0.3 upgrade of Visual Metrics removed a couple fixes that should be there [#740](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/740).

## 8.0.5 - 2019-01-27

### Fixed

- Bugfix: New Browsertime that fixes that the font in the video was to big when testing on mobile/emulated mobile in Chrome [#738](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/738).

## 8.0.4 - 2019-01-24

### Fixed

- New version of the Coach that catches if your firstParty regex doesn't match any requests.
- New Browsertime 4.0.3 with two bug fixes:
- Bugfix: Calculating Visual Complete 85/95/99 was broken IF the complete process went backward (first hitting 85% and then going down to < than 85%). We usedto always take the first metric over 85% and then stick to it. Now we choose the last time it breaks the 85/95/99% metric [#732](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/732).

- We updated the Visual Metrics lib to use the latest upstream version. We haven't updated for a while and we had issues where [the progress was calculated wrong](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2259#issuecomment-456878707) [#730](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/730).

## 8.0.3 - 2019-01-23

### Fixed

- Testing URLs that redirects made GPSI/Lighthouse fail as reported in [#2260](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2260). This is fixed in [#2262](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2262).

## 8.0.2 - 2019-01-22

### Fixed

- Added links to documentation to scripting/spa in the CLI.
- Updated to Browsertime 4.0.2 with one fix for [#2259](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2259).

## 8.0.1 - 2019-01-22

### Fixed

- WebPageTest, GPSI and Lighthouse now logs that they cannot handle scripting/multiple pages at the moment (and Lighthouse upgraded to the latest version in the Docker file).

## 8.0.0 - 2019-01-21

Read the blog post: [https://www.sitespeed.io/sitespeed.io-8.0-and-browsertime.4.0/](https://www.sitespeed.io/sitespeed.io-8.0-and-browsertime.4.0/).

### Added

- Upgraded to the Coach 3.0 with Privacy advice, see [https://www.sitespeed.io/coach-3.0/](https://www.sitespeed.io/coach-3.0/).
- Upgraded to PageXray 2.5.
- Upgraded to Chrome 71 and Firefox 64 in the Docker container
- Use fully loaded metric from the HAR instead of the Resource Timing API [#2242](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2242) and [#2244](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2244).
- Group metrics by type in HTML output [#2240](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2240)
- Show timing metrics in ms/s (instead of just ms) [#2245](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2245)
- Use Browsertime 4.0 that adds support for testing Single Page Applications and test multiple pages with scripting. See the [Browsertime changelog](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#400-beta1---2019-01-14) [#2236](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2236)
- There's a new and simpler way of setting up a budget file [#2252](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2252) and [#2253](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2253)

### Fixed

- Tag CPU data and Lighthouse data smarter that is sent to InfluxDB. Pre this version you could get the CPU data but it was kind of hard to understand the tags. With this fix we add a cpu tag that either is category or event. That way it's easier to pickup (and understand) that data. We also added a audit tag for Lighthouse tests sent to InfluxDB. Before the fix we just sent "score" but no tag telling which score. We now add a tag named audit that tells which audit that is used for the score.[#2225](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2225)
- Fixed running multiple URLs when using WebPageReplay [#2228](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2228).
- Page names in URLs (used in Graphite etc) now get paranthesis () replaced with an underscore [#2239](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2239).

### Tech

- Changed from moment to DayJS [#2200](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2200).
- Removed Bluebird and making sure we use native Promises and await/async [#2205](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2205).
- Removed old usage of var and replaced with let/const [#2241](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2241)

## 7.7.3 - 2018-12-21

### Fixed

- Docker container updated with latest Firefox and Chrome (to fix the Firefox update popup [#2234](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2234).

## 7.7.2 - 2018-10-25

### Fixed

- Multiple InfluxDB annotations bugs: The InfluxDb plugin sent a graphite.setup message to say it's alive (instead of influxdb.setup) doh [#2191](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2191). The tag handling was broken for annotations [#2192](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2192). Bug [#2190](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2190).

## 7.7.1 - 2018-10-24

### Fixed

- The wrong run was linked in the HAR file (and then wrongly displayed in compare.sitespeed.io) [#2188](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2188).
- Updated to Browsertime 3.11.1 that fixes the higher deviation in visual metrics in Chrome introduced in earlier version [Browsertime #655](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/655).

- Use latest Coach 2.4.0

## 7.7.0 - 2018-10-22

### Fixed

- New Browsertime 3.10.0 with latest ChromeDriver and a fix for the bug when you set a cookie and the same time use --cacheClearRaw.
- Upgraded to Perf Cascade 2.5.5

### Added

- Upgraded to Chrome 70 in the Docker container.

## 7.6.3 - 2018-10-16

### Fixed

- Screenshots for Grafana annotations wasn't working in earlier versions. Thank you Jonas Ulrich for reporting! [#2182](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2182).

## 7.6.2 - 2018-10-15

### Fixed

- New [Browsertime 3.8.2](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#382) that finally fixes the problem for Firefox introduced in 7.6.0.

## 7.6.1 - 2018-10-15

### Fixed

- In Browsertime 3.8.0 Firefox visual metrics was broken if you use the Browsertime extension (the first visual change was higher than it should). The problem was that orange div (that is used for video) didn't work with perfectly with the extension server [#649](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/649).

## 7.6.0 - 2018-10-15

### Added

- Upgraded to [Browsertime 3.8.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#380---2018-10-15). The new version changes how the change happen bewteen preURL/preScript and the URL being tested. Before we automatically turned the screen white between pre runs and the URL. Now we do not do that. The metrics will be the same but when you look at the video, it will start with the pre URL instead of a white screen. This fixes bugs like [#2091](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2091) where routing through hash wasn't getting the right first visual change (and other bugs).

## 7.5.2 - 2018-10-12

### Fixed

- The Lighthouse plugin always runs Lighthouse after Browsertime is finished (to make sure only one instance of Chrome runs at the same time).

## 7.5.1 - 2018-10-10

### Fixed

- Updated to Browsertime 3.7.1 that fixes the problem of setting User Agent in Firefox (and making --mobile fail when using Firefox).

## 7.5.0 - 2018-10-10

### Added

- Upgraded to Browsertime 3.5.0 with the following additions:

  - We support timings for visual elements (by adding `--visuaElements`). Browsertime picks up the largest image and the largest H1. You can also configure your own elements `--scriptInput.visualElements`. First let give credit to the ones that deserves it: As far as we know [Sergey Chernyshev](https://twitter.com/sergeyche) was the first one that introduced the idea of measuring individual elements in his talk [Using Heat Maps to improve Web Performance Metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6l9U5bC8jA). A couple of years later this was implemented by the [Joseph Wynn](https://twitter.com/joseph_wynn) of SpeedCurve, that later on contributed back the implementation to WebPageTest (calling it "hero"-elements). [Patrick Meenan](https://twitter.com/patmeenan) (the creator of WebPageTest) moved on the implementation to [Visual Metrics](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/visualmetrics) that Browsertime uses to pickup visual metrics from the video. We removed the [hero naming]() and now it's ready to use.

  - We also added a new feature: If you run your own custom script you can now feed it with different input by using `--browsertime.scriptInput.*`. Say you have a script named myScript you can pass on data to it with `--browsertime.scriptInput.myScript 'super-secret-string'`. More about this in the documentation the coming weeks.

  - Upgraded to ChromeDriver 2.42.0

- You can include screenshots in annotations sent to Graphite/InfluxDB [#2144](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2144). This makes it easy that from within Grafana see screenshots from every run.

- When linking to a sitespeed.io result we include index.html in the URL, so that you can use storages that doesn't automagically redirect from / to /index.html (a.k.a Digital Ocean storage).

- You can use `--injectJs` to inject JavaScript into the current page (only Firefox at the moment) at document_start. More info: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/contentScripts

- Browsertime collects the Firefox only metric _timeToDomContentFlushed_. It is also pushed to Graphite/InfluxDB by default. There are rumours saying that this metric will be betterthat time to non blank for some web sites.

- All metrics in the Paint Timing API (First Paint and First Contentful Paint in Chrome) are also pushed to Graphite/InfluxDB by default.

- All metrics are also reported with stddev (not only median stdev).

- There's a standalone [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) plugin that can be used from 7.5: https://github.com/sitespeedio/plugin-lighthouse
  And we made it easy to use Lighthouse and the GPSI plugin by releasing the +1 Docker container [#2175](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2175). You can run it with
  `docker run --shm-size=1g --rm -v "$(pwd)":/sitespeed.io sitespeedio/sitespeed.io:7.5.0-plus1 https://www.sitespeed.io/` and you will also automatically run Lighthouse and GPSI. We will automatically release a new version of the container per release by adding _-plus1_ to the tag. If you use Graphite/InfluxDb the score from Lighthouse and GPSI will be automatically stored. If you want to add functionality pleae send PRs to https://github.com/sitespeedio/plugin-lighthouse and https://github.com/sitespeedio/plugin-gpsi.

- We added support for Grafana annotations (instead of using Graphite/InfluxDB annotations). In Grafana 5.3.0-beta2 (and later) the annotations has template support. Use Grafana annotations by configure `--grafana.host` and `--grafana.port`.

- You can give alias for URLs in the CLI with `--urlAlias`. The number of alias needs to match the number of URLs. If you add the cli parameter, it will override alias that you can give to an URL within a file [#2133](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2133)

- We have been old and conservative in how we use # when creating URLs: From the beginning (6+ years ago) we always left out # from URLs when we decided if a URL is unique or not. Now you can choose yourself with `--useHash` [#2142](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2142).

- There's a new version of the dashboards for Graphite, trying to make it easier to find regressions: https://github.com/sitespeedio/grafana-bootstrap-docker

### Fixed

- Upgraded to Browsertime 3.7.0 that changed how Basic Auth is handled: We send a basic auth request header instead of using the build in Web Extension [#2151](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2151).

- Chrome in some case(s) generates a HAR with broken timings that caused sitespeed.io to log error and not being able to collect timings per domain [#2159](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2159). Fixed by [#2160](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2160).

- We updated to PageXray 2.4.0 that correctly pick up mime types for video/audio/xml and pdf (that was missed before).

- Updated to [Coach 2.3.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/coach/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) that fixes so that the CSS advice never can be a negative score.

- Fixed the bug that made us show wrong video/screenshot on page summary[#2169](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2169). Before we always showed the first screenshot/video. Now we show the median pick (so it correlates to the right waterfall and metrics tab).

- There have been multiple problems with navigations with hash route see for example [#2091](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2091). We fixed so we don't get that error + Chrome 69 changed the internal trace log so it (at least on our side) seems to work better. Please report back if you still see issues.

### Tech

- You can now use markdown in the pug templates - `!{markdown.toHTML(value)}`

## 7.4.0 - 2018-09-14

### Added

- Upgraded to Chrome 69 in the Docker container.
- Upgraded to Firefox 62 in the Docker container.

### Fixed

- Upgraded to Browsertime 3.4.1: There have been several [bugs](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1949) when using a preScript to login and then measure a page, resulting in errors. The problem has been how we find the first frame + a bug that didn't make the video with orange frames between different pages. Thats been fixed in [#633](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/633). Thank you [Grigory Kurmaev](https://github.com/Pe4enie) who shared the exact setup to reproduce the bug!

- There was a bug that made it impossible to set your own device name when running Chrome in emulated modeÂ [#2146](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2146).

## 7.3.6 - 2018-08-09

### Fixed

- Updated the CLI to link to how to setup connectivity.
- Detailed and summary page show wrong metrics if you test on multiple domains [#2134](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2134).
- Updated [fix release](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#331---2018-08-09) of Browsertime that makes the log cleaner and easier to use.

## 7.3.5 - 2018-07-29

### Fixed

- Updated the Docker container to use Chrome 68.

## 7.3.4 - 2018-07-26

### Fixed

- 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.3.3 got stuck at npm :(

## 7.3.1 - 2018-07-26

### Fixed

- There was a bug in 7.3.0 that broke the annotation link.

## 7.3.0 - 2018-07-25

### Fixed

- Added missing grups for a couple of Browsertime cli params so that when you run help all parameters are sorted in the right group [#2113](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2113).

### Added

- You can now append text and HTML to the annotation sent to Graphite. This is useful if you want to add extra info to the annotation. Use it like this `--graphite.annotationMessage` [#2114](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2114). Thanks to [@svampen](https://github.com/Svampen) that had the idea in [#2102](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2102).
- You can also add extra tags to the annotation `--graphite.annotationTag` [#2112](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2112).

## 7.2.3 - 2018-07-23

### Fixed

- Wrong formating for date for statsd in some cases as reported in [#2106](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2106). Fixed with [#2107](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2107) by [Omri](https://github.com/omrilotan) - much love :)

## 7.2.2 - 2018-07-20

### Fixed

- Updated to Browsertime 3.2.3 with two important fixes: Fix error log when you remove the video and keep visual metrics [Browsertime #621](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/621) and changed timeout from 5s to 50s when waiting on navigation [#623](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/623).

## 7.2.1 - 2018-07-15

### Fixed

- Updated Browsertime with 3.2.1 that fixes multiple cookies support and refreshed browsertime extension. Also fixes User Timing metrics using dots.
- Firefox sometimes creates a HAR that is broken, guard our code against HAR with null response content size [#2096](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2096).

## 7.2.0 - 2018-06-30

### Added

- Use Browsertime 3.2.0 that fixed Firefox browsertime extension support (broken in Firefox when we upgraded to 61 since FF changed the API) and added support for easily adding a cookie: `--cookie name=value`

## 7.1.3 - 2018-06-27

### Fixed

- Copy assets first before generating assets, making pages work even if parts fail [#2081](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2081).
- The Docker container uses Firefox 61 stable.
- Upgraded to [Browsertime 3.1.4](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#314---2018-06-25) including latest Geckodriver.
- Upgraded the [Coach to 2.0.4](https://github.com/sitespeedio/coach/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#204---2018-06-25) with a fix that makes sitespeed.io faster when generating the result if you you are using many runs.

and Coach 2.0.4.

## 7.1.2 - 2018-06-12

### Fixed

- Based on correct Docker container to get the right ADB version.

## 7.1.0 - 2018-06-12

### Added

- Upgraded to Chrome 67 see [#2069](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2069) about possible performance regressions. At least for Wikipedia some URLs are slower on 67 than 66. And since 67 now rolled out to a lot of people, you probably want to test with that version. See https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=849108
- Upgraded to Browsertime 3.1.2 with ChromeDriver 2.40
- Upgraded to Firefox 61 beta13
- Upgraded ADB to work together with ChromeDriver > 2.38, making driving Chrome on Android from Ubuntu Docker container work again.

## 7.0.3 - 2018-06-02

### Fixed

- Upgraded to PerfCasacde 2.5.2 that fixes Edge tab bug.
- Upgraded to Browsertime 3.1.0 with new ChromeDriver (2.39).
- Upgraded to Browsertime 3.1.1 with a fix for HTTP2 pushes in Chrome [#2068](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2068).

## 7.0.2 - 2018-06-01

### Fixed

- We reverted the change of using pageLoadStrategy _none_ as default (we now use normal as we done since day 1). This means it is easier for users that uses pre/post script = you will get control when the page has finished loading instead of when navigation starts. You can still use the none option by adding `--pageLoadStrategy none` to your run (that is useful if you want to end your tests earlier).

## 7.0.1 - 2018-05-30

### Fixed

- Upgraded to latest Browsertime (3.0.16) containing two fixes: Using Throttle changing networks failed in Docker for multiple runs [#2063](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2063) and HTTP2 push assests missing sometimes in the waterfall for Chrome [Chrome-HAR #21](https://github.com/sitespeedio/chrome-har/pull/21).

## 7.0.0 - 2018-05-24

Read more about [sitespeed.io 7.0](https://www.sitespeed.io/sitespeed.io-7.0/).

### Added

- A lot of love for WebPageTest: Bugfix for getting Chrome timing metrics per run [#2046](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2046), show the WebPageTests id and tester name in the HTML [#2047](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2047), use WebPageTest screenshot if you don't run Browsertime [#2048](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2048), show some Lighthouse metrics you use Lighthouse [#2049](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2049) and show some of those interactive metrics if they exists [#2050](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2050).
- Link directly to each individual run if you use WebPageTest [#2045](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2045).
- Add StatsD support (with bulking). Thank you [Omri](https://github.com/omrilotan) for the PR [#1994](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1994).
- We upgraded to [Browsertime 3.0](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#300).
- We upgraded the S3 plugin that fixes (all) the problems we have seen with large files failing to upload [#2013](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2013).
- Get console messages from Chrome in the HTML output and send the number of errors to Graphite/InfluxDB by default.
- You can now change safe char for groups/domain in InfluxDB with --influxdb.groupSeparator. Thank you [amic87](https://github.com/amic81) for your PR!

## Fixed

- InfluxDB event annotations overwrite within test session. Thanks [Michael J. Mitchell](https://github.com/mitchtech) for the PR [#1966](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1966).

- Sanitize path segments when creating folder (taking care of bad characters when creating new folders) - Thank you [Ryan Siddle](https://github.com/rsiddle) for the PR! [#1961](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1961)

- If you are a InfluxDB user, your tags now will hold more info (not only category tags). Thank you [Icecold777](https://github.com/Icecold777) for the PR [#2031](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2031)

## Changed

- We upgraded Browsertime to [3.0](https://www.sitespeed.io/browsertime-3.0/).

- To collect the Chrome timeline you should now use `--browsertime.chrome.timeline` instead of the old `--browsertime.chrome.collectTracingEvents`

- To collect Visual Metrics add `--visualMetrics` (instead of the old `--speedIndex`)

- You can now choose for what kind of content you want to include the response bodies when you use Firefox: `--browsertime.firefox.includeResponseBodies` 'none', 'all', 'html'

- We finetuned the tabs in the result pages and followed Browsertime and make all output 1 based instead of 0.

- We tried to make CLI parameters the same as with Browsertime, so that you can use the same for both tools (meaning most of the parameters you don't need to append with _browsertime_. Check sitespeed.io --help

## Breaking changes

As a sitespeed.io user there shouldn't be any breaking changes upgrading from 6.x to 7. However since Browsertime (and latest Firefox) is so much leaner and cleaner you will probably notice that most of your timing metrics will be lower than before.

<strike>If you are using a preScript to login the user, you need to wait/verify that the page has actually loaded before you try to manipulate the page, since Browsertime 3.0 change pageLoadStrategy from _normal_ to _none_ meaning you will be in control direct after the navigation.</strike> - We reverted this in 7.0.2.

### Plugin makers

- The screenshot is not passed as messages anymore to decrease the memory impact. If you need them, you need to get them from disk instead of the queue.
- The Chrome trace log is not passed as messages anymore to decrease the memory impact by default. Add `--postChromeTrace` to pass around the Chrome trace to other plugins.

## 6.5.3 2018-04-07

## Added

- Upgraded to Browsertime 2.5.0 with fixes for the HAR in Chrome 66 and fix with User Timing measurements. Thanks [@knaos](https://github.com/knaos) for reporting and finding the issue.

## 6.5.1 2018-03-22

### Fixed

- If the WebPageTest location contained a space, we sent that space to Graphite. That deosn't work, so we now make the location a safe key [#1958](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1958).

## 6.5.0 2018-03-20

### Added

- You can now choose if sitespeed.io will return an error exit code if your budget fails with --budget.suppressExitCode see [#1934](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1934) and [#1936](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1936)

- You can now set ACL for S3 uploads [#1937](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1937). Thank you [lbod](https://github.com/lbod) for the PR.

## 6.4.1 2018-03-07

### Fixed

- Upgraded from pug 2.0.0-rc4 to pug 2.0.0

## 6.4.0 2018-03-07

- Updated to latest Browsertime 2.2.2, checkout the [changelog](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/2.x/CHANGELOG.md#version-222-2018-02-22)

### Added

- We now show CPU stats for Chrome in the HTML and send it to Graphite if you configure Browsertime to collect it [#1914](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1914).

## 6.3.5 2018-02-13

### Fixed

- Adding --filterList as parameter made changing the metrics filter fail [#1915](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1915).

## 6.3.4 2018-02-11

### Fixed

- Changing the metrics filter didn't work since 6.x, there was an assumption about messages that was wrong. [#1912](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1912).

## 6.3.3 2018-02-08

### Fixed

- There's been a major slowdown between 5 -> 6 when you generated HTML as reported in [#1901](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1901). This has been fixed by [#1909](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1909) and made faster than in 5.x by [#1910](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1910).

## 6.3.2 2018-02-05

### Fixed

- Adding back the -preURL options that mystically has been removed from the CLI (--browsertime.preURL still worked though). Thanks [@aerwin](https://github.com/aerwin) for reporting - [#1904](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1904)
- There are user timings that broke the HTML output see [#1900](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1900)

## 6.3.1 2018-02-01

### Fixed

- In last release we accidently changed to only send first view metrics (by default) per page when you are using WebPagetest. We changed that and now send metrics for both first and second view. Thanks [@wolframkriesing](https://github.com/wolframkriesing) for letting us now.

- Guard against missing WPT data see [#1897](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1897) and [#1899](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1899).

## 6.3.0 2018-01-24

### Added

- Better default metrics for WebPageTest data in data storage. We now collect more metrics than before, see [#1871](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1871). Thank you [Jean-Pierre Vincent](https://github.com/jpvincent) for contributing with your better default values. Jean-Pierre has also contributed with [better dashboards](https://github.com/sitespeedio/grafana-bootstrap-docker) for WebPageTest.

- Upgraded to VideoJS 6.6 with smoother progress bar [#1864](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1864).

- Browsertime and WebPageTest plugin now sends browsertime.setup or webpagetest.setup when they are in the setup phase, so other plugins know that they will run [#1875](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1875).

- If you run WebPageTest standalone (without Browsertime) you will now get the the domains section using data from WebPageTest [#1876](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1876) and you will get annotations in Grafana [#1884](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1884).

- PageXray is now a standalone plugin (before it was bundled with the coach). This makes it easier to use PageXray on HAR files from other tools (WebPageTest at the moment). [#1877](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1877).

- PageXray is now xraying WebPageTest HAR files (if you run WebPageTest standalone). This will add the PageXray tab per URL/run + the toplist and the assets tab [#1880](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1880).

- Upgraded the Docker base container to Ubuntu 17.10, NodeJS 8.9.4 and the WebPageReplay container with Firefox 58.

- Added filenames to the video when you combine two videos in combineVideos.sh

- New version of the Coach that now knows if you include Facebook in your page.

### Fixed

- Upgraded to Browsertime 2.1.4 with [new bug fixes](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and newer ChromeDriver.

- Fixed the start script so that you on Ubuntu can run WebPageReplay in the Docker container for your Android phone.

- Chrome user timings was empty in the HTML output from WebPageTest [#1879](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1879).

## 6.2.3 2017-12-29

### Fixed

- Upgraded to PageXray 2.0.2 and Coach 1.1.2 that fixes [#1861](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1861). Redirect chains that redirected back to the main page caused out of memory.

## 6.2.2 2017-12-22

### Fixed

- The Docker container was missing the node MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE switch (so you can increase memory for NodeJS) [#1861](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1861).

## 6.2.1 2017-12-21

### Fixed

- Screenshot URLs in the HAR file was hardcoded to png, see [https://github.com/sitespeedio/compare/issues/11](https://github.com/sitespeedio/compare/issues/11). That made jpg image links broken in compare.sitespeed.io.

## 6.2.0 2017-12-20

### Added

- Use ChromeDriver 2.34
- Configure the page complete time when you use WebPageReplay. Add -e WAIT 5000 to wait 5000 ms.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with configuring pageCompleteCheck (and probably other problems too) in the Docker container [#1858](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1858).

## 6.1.2 2017-12-12

### Fixed

- We finally fixed (we hope) the SigV4 problem on uploading to S3 see [#1689](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1689)

## 6.1.1 2017-12-12

### Fixed

- Better check for when the page has finished loading when you run WebPageReplay (load event end + 2 s).

## 6.1.0 2017-12-12

### Added

- Let plugin register message types for budget [#1828](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1828). With this you can add your plugin metrics to the budget.

- Let plugins run async JavaScript in Browsertime [#1841](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1841).

- Use [sharp](http://sharp.dimens.io/) to change the size of the screenshot and choose between png/jpg [#1838](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1838)

- Updated to Chrome 63 in the Docker container.

### Fixed

- Crawling now works with Basic Auth [#1845](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1845) and [#1506](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1506).
- Fix broken metrics list [#1850](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1850). Thank you https://github.com/suratovvlad for reporting.

## 6.0.3 2017-11-29

- Updated to Browsertime 2.0.1 with [fixes for Android](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-201-2017-11-28).

## 6.0.2 2017-11-28

### Fixed

- Yesterdays fix broke the functionality of adding/removing plugins with a comma-separated list [#1833](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1833).

## 6.0.1 2017-11-27

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug adding/removing multiple plugins see [#1831](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1831).

## 6.0.0 2017-11-24

Before you upgrade, please read our [upgrade guide](https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/upgrade/).

### Added

- Use Chartist to display visual progress and size/requests to make it easier for users [#1659](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1659).

- The HTML pages now works better on larger screens [#1740](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1740).

- We upgraded to use the official Graphite Docker container and using Graphite 1.X as default [#1735](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1735).

- Log the full URL to your result, makes it easy to map logs vs result [#1744](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1744).

- Make it easier do build plugins: Expose messageMaker in the context to plugins (so plugins easily can send messages in the queue) [#1760](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1760). Expose filterRegistry in
  the context so plugins can register which metrics should be picked up by Graphite/InfluxDb etc [#1761](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1761). Move core functionality to core folder [#1762](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1762).

- Running Docker adds `--video` and `--speedIndex` by default to make it easier for beginners.

- You can now create plugins that can generate HTML (per run or per page summary). [#1784](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1784).

- You can now override/add CSS from your plugin by sending message of the type _html.css_ [#1787](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1787)

- Major work on the documentation: [https://www.sitespeed.io/](https://www.sitespeed.io/)

- The Coach 1.0 with tweaked advice about Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager and more.

### Bug fixes

- We finally exit with 1 (error) if one of the URLs fails.[#1267](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1267) and [#1779](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1779).

### Deprecations

- The `--plugins.load` and `--plugins.disable` options are deprecated in favour of `--plugins.add` and `--plugins.remove`. The previous syntax was cumbersome to use since it allowed for multiple plugins to be separated by space. When using it before the url argument, e.g.

```sh
sitespeed.io -plugins.load foo http://sitespeed.io
```

the url would be treated as a plugin name, and the command would fail.

### Breaking changes

- Update to PageXray 1.0. For 99% of the users this will not change anything but if you where sending assets timings to Graphite/InfluxDB (as we told you not to do, these you now get blocked, dns, connect, send, wait and receive instead of just the total time [#1693](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1693).

- We removed the generic [DataCollector](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/blob/5.x/lib/plugins/datacollector/index.js) that collected data for each run and instead each plugin should collect the data
  it needs [#1731](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1731). If you have written a plugin that collect it owns
  data you can just follow the old [DataCollector structure](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/blob/5.x/lib/plugins/datacollector/index.js) and move the code you need to your plugin. Also [#1767](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1767) is a follow up to remove DataCollector.

- We now default to Graphite 1.x so if you send annotations to Graphite < 1.0 you need to configure arrayTags to false `--graphite.arrayTags false`

- We now output only the version number (and not package and version number) on --version.

- As a first step to make it possible for plugins to generate HTML, we removed the hooks and instead only communicates with messages see: [#1732](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1732) [#1758](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1758). We now have three messages sent by the queue:
  _sitespeedio.setup_ - The first message on the queue. A plugin can pickup this message and communicate with other plugins (send pugs to the HTML plugin, send JavaScript to Browsertime etc). The next message is _sitespeedio.summarize_ (old summarize) that tells the plugins that all URLs are analysed and you can now summarise the metrics. The last message is _sitespeedio.render_ which tells the plugins to render content to disk. The HTML plugin pickup _sitespeedio.render_, render the HTML and then sends a _html.finished_ message, that then other plugins can pickup.

- We have moved the GPSI outside of sitespeed.io and you can find it [here](https://github.com/sitespeedio/plugin-gpsi). To run in along with sitespeed.io you just follow [the instructions how to add a plugin](https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/plugins/#add-a-plugin). We moved it outside of sitespeed.io to make the code base cleaner and with the hope that we can find a maintainer who can give it more love.

- The [StorageManager](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/blob/master/lib/core/resultsStorage/storageManager.js) API has been updated. The following changes may break code written using the 5.x API:

  - `createDataDir(directoryName)` is now `createDirectory(...directoryNames)` and takes any number of directory names (which will be joined together) as arguments.
  - `writeData(filename, data)` has reversed the order of its arguments. It is now `writeData(data, filename)`.
  - `writeHtml(filename, html)` has reversed the order of its arguments. It is now `writeHtml(html, filename)`.
  - `writeDataForUrl(data, filename, url, subDir)` no longer has a fifth argument indicating whether output should be gzipped.
  - `writeHtmlForUrl(html, filename, url)` no longer has a fourth argument indicating whether output should be gzipped.

  Note that all compression functionality has been removed. If you need compressed output, your plugin should handle gzipping itself. See the [`harstorer` plugin](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/blob/56bfc48bac7ccfe1cfe35c829b4dd11987a375e4/lib/plugins/harstorer/index.js#L19-L28) for an example.

- Skip storing faulty toplists on disk when using the analysisstorer plugin. The lists is generated from the raw data, so if you need them yourself as JSON, you can generate them [#1721](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1721)
- Upgraded to latest shining [Browsertime](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-193-2017-09-29)

## 5.6.2 2017-09-17

### Not backward compatible changes in 5.0

There's one change in 5.0 that changes the default behavior: TSProxy isn't default for connectivity since it doesn't work as we want together with Selenium. We also removed tc as default running Docker. When you change connectivity you should use our [Docker network setup](https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/browsers/#change-connectivity)! If you used to use TSProxy or tc, please switch to Docker networks for now.

## 4.7.0 2017-03-15

- Browsertime is now using https://github.com/sitespeedio/chrome-har to generate the HAR.
- Pickup the number of script tags on the page (from the Coach) and display it in the Coach section and send by default to Graphite.
- Show SpeedIndex, FirstVisualChange and LastVisualChange in colums for pages (so you can sort them).

  - We removed the center cropping of images when visual metrics checks if an image is orange/white. The cropping made us miss the small orange lines that sometimes appear only in Chrome.
  - We also fine tuned (and made configurable) the number when the diff of two images (orange and white) is ... orange.
  - We re-arranged how we record the screen to record as little extra video as possible

- The key summary structure for metrics for WebPageTest just worked because of luck. It is now divided in pageSummary and summary making it easier to configure and understand. #1377
- Fixed encoding problems when storing to disk #1346

## 4.1.3 2016-12-05

### Fixed

- Running budget with one rule for one URL failed the JUnit output, thanks @krukru for the report #1317

### Added

- Pick up environment variables in the CLI. The namespace is SITESPEED_IO. This is useful for setting up default values in Docker.

  - Upgraded sltc so we use 0.6.0 with simplified tc that actually works
  - We now run xvfb from inside NodeJS so we can set the screen size, making it easy to record the correct size for VisualMetrics. We also use environment variables that starts with BROWSERTIME so we can turn on xvfb easily on Docker.
    https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

## 4.0.4 2016-11-04

### Fixed

- If you where using graphite.includeQueryParams when you where sending keys to graphite, URLs containing ? and & failed. Those characters are now replaced.
- We rollbacked sending the URL in Graphite keys for toplists, it's opened the possibility to generate too much data in Graphite.

## 4.0.3 2016-11-01

### Fixed

- Setting --mobile didn't change viewport/useragent. Thank you @zhangzhaoaaa for reporting #1298

### Fixed

- If you configured cli params for Chrome, the check for Android configuration broke the run.
- The CLI output was wrong when setting up a custom profile. You should use --connectivity custom

## 4.0.0 2016-10-27

Version 4.0 is a ground up rewrite for Node.js 6.9.1 and newer. It builds on all our experience since shipping 3.0 in December 2014, the first version to use Node.js.

- We support HTTP/2! In 3.X we used PhantomJS and a modified version of YSlow to analyse best practice rules. We also had BrowserMobProxy in front of our browsers that made it impossible to collect metrics using H2. We now use the coach and Firefox/Chrome without a proxy. That makes it easier for us to adapt to browser changes and changes in best practices.

- We got the feature that people asked about the most: Measure a page as a logged in user. Use --browsertime.preScript to run a selenium task to before the page is analysed. Documentation is coming soon.

- New HAR files rock! In the old version we use BrowserMobProxy as a proxy in front of the browser to collect the HAR. In the new version we collect the HAR directly from the browser. For Firefox we use the HAR export trigger and in Chrome we generates it from the performance log.

- Stability: We have a new completely rewritten version of Browsertime that makes it easier for us to catch errors from the browser, drivers and environment problems.

- Speed: Yep we dropped Java (it was needed for BrowserMobProxy) and most things are happening in parallel with the new version.

- Don't overload Graphite: One thing that was annoying with 3.x was that it by default sent a massive amount of metrics to Graphite. That's cool in a way but it was too much. We now send curated metrics by default and you can choose to send more.

- You can collect metrics from Chrome on an Android phone. In the current version you need to have it connected using USB to the server running sitespeed.io, lets see how we can make it better in the future.

- Using our Docker container you will get support getting SpeedIndex and startRender using VisualMetrics. This is highly experimental at this stage.

And many many more changed. Read about the release https://www.sitespeed.io/sitespeed.io-4.0-is-released

- Disable default plugins (disable HTML, screenshot etc). Looking forward to add plugins #1015
- Configure the pageCompleteCheck using CLI.
- Moved metrics to different tabs on the page result page.
- Set the number of runs for WebPageTest using a specific cli parameter #1101
- Run custom script and URL/script for WebPageTest #1101
- Run custom script. Use --browsertime.script myScript.js to add your script. You can run multiple script by passing the parameter multiple times. The metrics will automatically turn up on the summary page, detailed page, the summary page of the page and the run page. They will also be sent to Graphite. #1063
- Add your own plugin (examples coming soon) #891
- Removed analysisStorer as default plugin (do not store all json metrics by default). If you want to use it, enable it with --plugins.load analysisStorer
- Always show the waterfall if you run one run.
- You can configure which metrics to send to Graphite #943
- Send domain, expireStats and lastModifiedStats to Graphite for a group summary and totalDomains for page summary.
- Send documentHeight, domElements, domDepth.avg, domDepth.max and iframes per default for each page summary (missed those, these are handy!).

### Changed

- All URLs is now belonging to a group. The group right now is the domain of the URL. When summaries are sent to Graphite, each summary belong to a group. Meaning summary metrics will always correspond to the group (not as before the filename if you get the URLs from a file). #1145
- New default namespace for Graphite metrics: sitespeed_io.default to be more flexible for the dashboards we will supply
- Removed p10 and p99 as default to Graphite (and all calculations). We make it configurable in the future from the cli (it's prepared already).

## 4.0.0-alpha5 - 2016-06-30

---

- Added browser and connectivity to Graphite keys, all keys now hold browser and connectivity.

### Added

- Hey we now log the the log file in the result dir.

## version 4.0.0-alpha1 - 2016-05-22

### Changed

- Everything! Rewrite from scratch in progress. This is an alpha release, try it test it but do not upgrade in production yet (https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/945).

- We support HTTP/2! In 3.X we used PhantomJS and a modified version of YSlow to analyse best practice rules. We also had BrowserMobProxy in front of our browsers that made it impossible to collect metrics using H2. We now use [the coach](https://github.com/sitespeedio/coach) and Firefox/Chrome without a proxy. That makes it easier for us to adapt to browser changes and changes in best practices.

- We now support the feature that people asked about the most: Measure a page as a logged in user. Use --browsertime.preTask to run a selenium task to before the page is analysed. Documentation is coming soon.

- New HAR files rock! In the old version we use BrowserMobProxy as a proxy in front of the browser to collect the HAR. In the new version we collect the HAR directly from the browser. For Firefox we use the [HAR export trigger](https://github.com/firebug/har-export-trigger) and in Chrome we generates it from the performance log.

- Stability: We have a new completely rewritten version of [Browsertime](https://github.com/tobli/browsertime) that makes it easier for us to catch errors from the browser, drivers and environment problems.

- Speed: Yep we dropped Java (it was needed for BrowserMobProxy) and most things are happening in parallel with the new version.

- Don't overload Graphite: One thing that was annoying with 3.x was that it by default sent a massive amount of metrics to Graphite. That's cool in a way but it was too much. We now send curated metrics by default and you can choose to send more.

- You can collect metrics from Chrome on an Android phone. In the current version you need to have it connected using USB to the server running sitespeed.io, lets see how we can make it better in the future.

- Using our Docker container you will get support getting SpeedIndex and startRender using [VisualMetrics](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/visualmetrics). This is highly experimental at this stage.

- Grunt-sitespeedio fails the build no matter if GPSI score matches the budget thanks @laer #746
- Fixed the ability to supress domain data beeing sent to Graphite. Using --graphiteData you now need to explicit use domains if you want to send the data (if you don't use all). That data shouldn't always be sent as it was before. (thanks @xo4n for pointing that out) #755

### Added

- Add ability to budget on a per rule basis, thanks @jzoldak #751

### Fixed

- Parameters passed in the wrong order for basic auth when taking screenshots, thanks @jzoldak for the PR! #691
- Use same time out time when taking screenshots and when running yslow #725

- Removed faulty error logging from WPT if your location missed browser configuration. That was wrong, you actually don't need it.
- Basic Auth was missing when testing one page (since 3.7.0). Thank you Jesse Zoldak (@jzoldak) for the PR! #717
- You can now pass configuration files again. When you do a run, the config.json will be in your result folder. Pass it again with
  --configFile to your next run and it will be tested again, but in a new date result dir #270

### Added

- Pass request headers as JSON as complement to all headers in a file #715, thank you Devrim Tufan (@tufandevrim) for the PR.

## version 3.7.2 - 2015-07-21

- Send all individual navigation timings to Graphite (before we only sent calculated timings) #580
- Send sitespeed and browser version to Graphite. The keys in Graphite: [namespace].meta.chrome.version, [namespace].meta.firefox.version and [namespace].meta.sitespeed.version #703

### Changed

- Bumping versions: async, cross-spawn-async, fast-stats, fs-extra, handlebars, html-minifier, moment, phantomjs, request, winston, browsertime & xmlbuilder.
- If we just test one page, then skip the crawling (but do one request that checks the status of the page before we start) #706

### Fixed

- Text fixes, thanks @atdt #690
- New Browsertime version fixes Browser name and browser version in the HAR file #704

## version 3.6.3 - 2015-06-26

Every occurrence of {{{URL}}} in your script will be replaced with the URL that is actually going to be tested. Feed the script file to sitespeed.io using --wptScript #623

- When we are at it: also support custom scripts to collect metrics for WebPageTest! Feed your custom javascript metrics file using --wptCustomMetrics. Read more here: https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/custom-metrics #678

- Graphite keys now replaces pipe, comma and plus. If your URL:s has them, they will now be replaced by a underscore. The reason is that some Grafana functions don't work with the special characters. Thanks @EikeDawid for the PR! #679

## version 3.5 - 2015-04-24

- Rewrite of the Graphite key generation, now always follow the patter protocol.my_domain_com.\_then_the_path #651.
  The cool thing is that this opens for a lot og Graphite/Grafana goodies, the bad is that if you use it today,
  you need to remap the keys in Grafana to get the graphs.

## version 1.8.3

- Supply a test name that will be shown on all pages. Use the the parameter -n
- Well the problem is like this: Today there is no way to get the ttfb from PhantomJS so it is fetched by a extra request using curl. Some sites that don't cache internally (and are slow) can differ quite much for ttfb, meaning ttfb can be higher the next request than the load time the first time. If this happens it is now highlighted.
- Bug fix: show median front/back end time instead of percentile on summary page
- Bug fix: when the ttfb is larger than pageload, don't add it to summary stats

- Bug fix: For some sites (example www.bike.se) the total weight was fetched wrong by YSlow, now the weight is calculated from each assets on the pages info page.
- Bug fix: Urls containing & broke some tests
