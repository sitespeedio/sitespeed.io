# CHANGELOG - sitespeed.io

## UNRELEASED

### Fixed
* Verify that you add the host when you want to send metrics to Graphite [#15879](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1587)

### Added
* Added a new script /tools/combineVideos.sh to combine two videos into one
* Include the browser name in the file name when you download a file [#1594](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1594)
* Show backEndTime in Summary Timings (to make it easy to find runs with same backEndTime) [#1595](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1595)
* Always log the WebPageTest id in the error logs if WebPageTest fails.
* Upgraded to [PerfCascade 2.0.0](https://github.com/micmro/PerfCascade/releases/tag/v2.0.0) with performance improvements and keyboard accessibility.
* New Browsertime 1.2.0 with fine tuned video for Firefox and Basic Auth support in Chrome.

## 5.0.0 2017-04-24

### Added
* Rework of the WebPageTest result tab: More metrics, requests per content type, requests per domain and screenshot.
* Rework of PageXray result tab: requests per content type, requests per domain, cookies stats
* Rework of Browsertime result tab: easier to find the most important metrics
* More info from GPSI on the result tab.
* Always download screenshots, waterfall graphs, and Chrome traceLog and store it local from WebPageTest.
* Better HTML page titles, showing what's tested and when, that makes it easier when you share URLs.
* HTML tuning for smaller devices.
* Added proxy parameters in the CLI from Browsertime.
* Updated to [PerfCascade 1.4.0](https://github.com/micmro/PerfCascade/releases) (from 1.0.0)
* Add new s3.path option, to override the default storage path in the S3 bucket.
* Pickup timestamp from each run and display on each run page
* Added possibility to set the graphite web host (--graphite.webHost)
* Set Graphite tags as arrays (--graphite.arrayTags) needed for Graphite 1.0
* Add request headers with -r name:value (Chrome only in this release)
* Block domains with --block my.domain.com (Chrome only in this release)

### Changed
* The default upload path in S3 buckets no longer includes the prefix 'sitespeed-result'

### Fixed
* Waterfall graphs loaded in Safari iOS didn't work.
* Allow S3 upload even when using custom outputFolder.

### Not backward compatible changes in 5.0
There's one change in 5.0 that changes the default behavior: TSProxy isn't default for connectivity since it doesn't work as we want together with Selenium. We also removed tc as default running Docker. When you change connectivity you should use our [Docker network setup](https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/browsers/#change-connectivity)! If you used to use TSProxy or tc, please switch to Docker networks for now.

## 4.7.0 2017-03-15
### Fixed
* Link User Timings in Page Summary (so you easy can find min/median/max of your User Timings).
* Slack missed URL specific information introduced in the 4.6.1 release. Now you get info per URL again.
* Default values for warning and error in Slack was wrong. Before warning was 80 and error 90, now warning is 90 and error 80.
* Setting a speedIndex/firstVisualChange as a warning/error value for Slack didn't work.

### Added
* Design: Make it easy to see which run you are looking at on by highlighting that run on the run list. Unified metrics naming.
* Made it possible to gzip the HAR files.
* Made it easy to download WebPageTest HAR files.
* A loader indicating that we are waiting in the HAR when it is fetched.

## 4.6.1 2017-03-11

### Fixed
* New Chromedriver 2.28.0 that fixes "Cannot get automation extension from unknown error: page could not be found ..."
* The help for budget had wrong example parameter. Use --budget.configPath for path to the config.

## 4.6.0 2017-03-10

### Added
* You can now choose to load the HAR file using the fetch API instead of inlining it in the HTML file. Use --html.fetchHARFiles [#1484](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1484)
* New version of Browsertime that has a new metric VisualComplete 85% (or more), thank you [@jeroenvdb](https://github.com/JeroenVdb)! You can see the metric in the Waterfall graph and it will automatically be sent to Graphite.
* Browsertime is now using https://github.com/sitespeedio/chrome-har to generate the HAR.
* Pickup the number of script tags on the page (from the Coach) and display it in the Coach section and send by default to Graphite.
* Show SpeedIndex, FirstVisualChange and LastVisualChange in colums for pages (so you can sort them).
* Send number of script tags, local storage size and number of cookies by default to Graphite.

* Added CLI options for setting Firefox preferences (--browsertime.firefox.preference), collect the response body in Firefox HAR (--browsertime.firefox.includeResponseBodies) and Chrome browser CLI args (--browsertime.chrome.args).
* You can now collect the timeline log from Chrome (--browsertime.chrome.dumpTraceCategoriesLog) and set which traceCategories Chrome should collect.
* If you collect the timeline from WebPageTest (--webpagetest.timeline) it will automatically be stored in your data folder and linked from that runs HTML page.
* New Browsertime release where you can set the connectivity type to external, that makes it possible to use Docker network bridges for setting up connectivity, more about that soon in the blog post. Thank you [@worenga](https://github.com/worenga) for higlighting the problem!

### Fixed
* Set region for your S3 bucket, thanks [@jjethwa](https://github.com/jjethwa) for the [PR](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/1469)!

* If we have a site that is missing expire headers, the HTML generation failed [1430](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1430)

## 4.3.8 2017-01-19
### Fixed
* Updated to latest PerfCascade that will pickup changed resource prio in Chrome and some bug fixes.
* Google is still overloading User Timing marks see [#257](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/257). This fix mute the marks from WebPageTest so they aren't sent to Graphite.

## 4.3.7 2017-01-13
### Fixed
* Google is overloading User Timing marks see [#257](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/257). This is quick fix, lets make a better fix in the future.

### Fixed (hopefully)
* Upgraded to [Browsertime beta 21](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-beta21-2017-01-09) to finally once and for all fix the problem with the too early firstVisualChange that sometimes happend in Chrome:
  * We removed the center cropping of images when visual metrics checks if an image is orange/white. The cropping made us miss the small orange lines that sometimes appear only in Chrome.
  * We also fine tuned (and made configurable) the number when the diff of two images (orange and white) is ... orange.
  * We re-arranged how we record the screen to record as little extra video as possible

## 4.3.3 2017-01-05
### Fixed
* Upgraded browsertime with changed FFMPeg config to hopefully fix the too early firstVisualChange that sometimes happens for Chrome, updated Geckodriver (0.12.0), changed Firefox default settings to follow the Mozilla teams default ones when they do test automation,
pickup changed request prio in Chrome (before only initial prio was used) and adding new connectivity profile 3gem for Emerging markets to keep in sync with WebPageTest.

* The keys for assets in PageXray was broken when we sent them to Graphite, because we couldn't identify which asset we sent, instead of the URL we used the position in the array. We fixed that now, BUT: Please don't send all the assets to Graphite, it will fill your disk! #1341
* The key summary structure for metrics for WebPageTest just worked because of luck. It is now divided in pageSummary and summary making it easier to configure and understand. #1377
* Fixed encoding problems when storing to disk #1346

## 4.1.3 2016-12-05

### Added
* Output preURL info on the runInfo box on each HTML page.
* If we have first and last visual change add it to the HAR file so we can see it in the waterfall graph.

### Fixed
* Output Speed Index and First Visual Change in page summary box (the logic was there for SpeedIndex before but failed).
* Added missing shorthand --preURL to the CLI options.

## 4.1.0 2016-12-01
### Fixed
* Cli help options for Browsertime was very unclear and unspecific.
* TSProxy is somehow broken together with Selenium. TC is now default connectivity engine when running in Docker.

### Added
* Additional information added in the documentation around using connectivity engine `tc` for network throttling.
* Additional information added in the FAQ section of the documentation mentioning Digital Ocean issue with pre-baked docker(1.12.3) instances and Firefox.

## 4.0.5 2016-11-11
### Fixed
* Running budget with one rule for one URL failed the JUnit output, thanks @krukru for the report #1317

### Added
* Pick up environment variables in the CLI. The namespace is SITESPEED_IO. This is useful for setting up default values in Docker. Say you want to set an environment variable for --browsertime.iterations 1 then use SITESPEED_IO_BROWSERTIME__ITERATIONS=1. Checkout https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs#envprefix for full docs.

* Upgraded to Browsertime 1.0.0-beta.10:
  * Added initiator of each request entry to chrome HAR
  * Output SpeedIndex & firstVisualChange in the logs if you use VisualMetrics
  * Generating HAR files from Chrome caused a crash in some cases.

  * Upgraded sltc so we use 0.6.0 with simplified tc that actually works
  * We now run xvfb from inside NodeJS so we can set the screen size, making it easy to record the correct size for VisualMetrics. We also use environment variables that starts with BROWSERTIME so we can turn on xvfb easily on Docker.
https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

## 4.0.4 2016-11-04
### Fixed
* If you where using graphite.includeQueryParams when you where sending keys to graphite, URLs containing ? and & failed. Those characters are now replaced.
* We rollbacked sending the URL in Graphite keys for toplists, it's opened the possibility to generate too much data in Graphite.
* FYI: Soon we will update to the final 3.0.0 of Selenium and we then need to drop support for NodeJS 4.x.


## 4.0.3 2016-11-01
### Fixed
* Setting --mobile didn't change viewport/useragent. Thank you @zhangzhaoaaa for reporting #1298

* Asset toplist data (slowest/largest assets) couldn't be sent to Graphite. It's now restructured with new naming and you can also get the URL for slowest
assets toplist in Graphite. Documentation coming up the coming days. #1294

## 4.0.2 2016-10-31
### Fixed
* Domains metrics wasn't grouped per domain, making metrics sent to Graphite fail if you configure them to send all. See #1290 and #1289.

## 4.0.1 2016-10-30
### Fixed
* If you configured cli params for Chrome, the check for Android configuration broke the run.
* The CLI output was wrong when setting up a custom profile. You should use --connectivity custom

## 4.0.0 2016-10-27
Version 4.0 is a ground up rewrite for Node.js 6.9.1 and newer. It builds on all our experience since shipping 3.0 in December 2014, the first version to use Node.js.

* We support HTTP/2! In 3.X we used PhantomJS and a modified version of YSlow to analyze best practice rules. We also had BrowserMobProxy in front of our browsers that made it impossible to collect metrics using H2. We now use the coach and Firefox/Chrome without a proxy. That makes it easier for us to adapt to browser changes and changes in best practices.

* We got the feature that people asked about the most: Measure a page as a logged in user. Use --browsertime.preScript to run a selenium task to before the page is analyzed. Documentation is coming soon.

* New HAR files rock! In the old version we use BrowserMobProxy as a proxy in front of the browser to collect the HAR. In the new version we collect the HAR directly from the browser. For Firefox we use the HAR export trigger and in Chrome we generates it from the performance log.

* Stability: We have a new completely rewritten version of Browsertime that makes it easier for us to catch errors from the browser, drivers and environment problems.

* Speed: Yep we dropped Java (it was needed for BrowserMobProxy) and most things are happening in parallel with the new version.

* Don't overload Graphite: One thing that was annoying with 3.x was that it by default sent a massive amount of metrics to Graphite. That's cool in a way but it was too much. We now send curated metrics by default and you can choose to send more.

* You can collect metrics from Chrome on an Android phone. In the current version you need to have it connected using USB to the server running sitespeed.io, lets see how we can make it better in the future.

* Using our Docker container you will get support getting SpeedIndex and startRender using VisualMetrics. This is highly experimental at this stage.

And many many more changed. Read about the release https://www.sitespeed.io/sitespeed.io-4.0-is-released

## 4.0.0-beta.1 2016-09-02
-------------------------
### Fixed
* The CSS size advice on summary page used the wrong metrics to check the color, meaning 0 bytes made it red :/
* Shorten long URLs displayed on HTML Asset report #977
* Empty size fixes for tablet view of HTML report
* Title/description for each page says something about the page + we don't want robots to index the result pages
* Fixed long URLs that broke page design #1020 #1049
* Right CLI parameter name for setting the Selenium URL (if you use a standalone server)
* Made it easier to understand how to configure location and connectivity for WebPageTest.
* Fixed breaking GPSI when summary was missing from the rule. #1110
* Updated browsertime, so when you are running pre/post script, you can get hold of the selenium-webdriver from the context (a lot of people have had problem with it). Checkout https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/test/prepostscripts/preLoginExample.js for an example.
* Finally Firefox works again, you can use Firefox 48 since we now use Geckodriver.

* Moved metrics to different tabs on the page result page.
* Set the number of runs for WebPageTest using a specific cli parameter #1101
* Run custom script and URL/script for WebPageTest #1101
* Run custom script. Use --browsertime.script myScript.js to add your script. You can run multiple script by passing the parameter multiple times. The metrics will automatically turn up on the summary page, detailed page, the summary page of the page and the run page. They will also be sent to Graphite. #1063

* Removed analysisStorer as default plugin (do not store all json metrics by default). If you want to use it, enable it with --plugins.load analysisStorer
* Always show the waterfall if you run one run.
* You can configure which metrics to send to Graphite #943
* Send domain, expireStats and lastModifiedStats to Graphite for a group summary and totalDomains for page summary.

### Changed
* All URLs is now belonging to a group. The group right now is the domain of the URL. When summaries are sent to Graphite, each summary belong to a group. Meaning summary metrics will always correspond to the group (not as before the filename if you get the URLs from a file). #1145
* New default namespace for Graphite metrics: sitespeed_io.default to be more flexible for the dashboards we will supply
* Removed p10 and p99 as default to Graphite (and all calculations). We make it configurable in the future from the cli (it's prepared already).

## 4.0.0-alpha5 - 2016-06-30
-------------------------
### Fixed
* It looks like url is field that can't be used in pug, so we where missing the URL on each individual page. Renamed and fixed.

### Added
* Added the detailed summary page that we learned to love.
* Small summary on each summary page to display the run information.
* More summary boxes on the summary page.
* Updated Browsertime to new release including latest Selenium to make Firefox 47.0.1 work.
* Added definition and help for the metrics in the summary boxes.

## 4.0.0-alpha4 - 2016-06-20
-------------------------
### Added
* Use PerfCascade to show waterfall on page summary and individual runs from collected HAR (#997)
* Show simple Google Page Speed Insights metrics in HTML and send the score to Graphite (#948)

### Changed
* Lets use Chrome as default browser since Firefox 47/Selenium/Gecko/Marionette is broken https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/993

* Only add browser/connectivity in Graphite keys in metrics collected by Browsertime (#1009).

* Add location/connectivity to Graphite keys for WebPageTest (#1008).

* Internal: We changed from Jade to Pug (latest) and moved to Sass for the CSS (thanks @matthojo)

## 4.0.0-alpha3 - 2016-06-09
-------------------------

### Fixed
* Enable the coach by default.
* Fixed broken default plugin loading.

## 4.0.0-alpha2 - 2016-06-07
-------------------------
### Fixed
* Show results from other plugins even if one plugin has an error (e.g. WebPageTest fails but Browsertime succeeds).
* Fixed preTask and postTaks, now named preScript/postScript, try iy out to login the user.


### Changed
* Added browser and connectivity to Graphite keys, all keys now hold browser and connectivity.

### Added
* Hey we now log the the log file in the result dir.

version 4.0.0-alpha1 - 2016-05-22
-------------------------
### Changed
* Everything! Rewrite from scratch in progress. This is an alpha release, try it test it but do not upgrade in production yet (https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/945).

* We support HTTP/2! In 3.X we used PhantomJS and a modified version of YSlow to analyze best practice rules. We also had BrowserMobProxy in front of our browsers that made it impossible to collect metrics using H2. We now use [the coach](https://github.com/sitespeedio/coach) and Firefox/Chrome without a proxy. That makes it easier for us to adapt to browser changes and changes in best practices.

* We now support the feature that people asked about the most: Measure a page as a logged in user. Use --browsertime.preTask to run a selenium task to before the page is analyzed. Documentation is coming soon.

* New HAR files rock! In the old version we use BrowserMobProxy as a proxy in front of the browser to collect the HAR. In the new version we collect the HAR directly from the browser. For Firefox we use the [HAR export trigger](https://github.com/firebug/har-export-trigger) and in Chrome we generates it from the performance log.

* Stability: We have a new completely rewritten version of [Browsertime](https://github.com/tobli/browsertime) that makes it easier for us to catch errors from the browser, drivers and environment problems.

* Speed: Yep we dropped Java (it was needed for BrowserMobProxy) and most things are happening in parallel with the new version.

* Don't overload Graphite: One thing that was annoying with 3.x was that it by default sent a massive amount of metrics to Graphite. That's cool in a way but it was too much. We now send curated metrics by default and you can choose to send more.

* You can collect metrics from Chrome on an Android phone. In the current version you need to have it connected using USB to the server running sitespeed.io, lets see how we can make it better in the future.

* Using our Docker container you will get support getting SpeedIndex and startRender using [VisualMetrics](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/visualmetrics). This is highly experimental at this stage.

------------------------
### Fixed
* Typos #804 Thanks @beenanner

* Making slimerjs more indepenedent from phantomjs #806 thanks @keithamus

* Grunt-sitespeedio fails the build no matter if GPSI score matches the budget thanks @laer #746
* Fixed the ability to supress domain data beeing sent to Graphite. Using --graphiteData you now need to explicit use domains if you want to send the data (if you don't use all). That data shouldn't always be sent as it was before. (thanks @xo4n for pointing that out) #755

### Added
* Add ability to budget on a per rule basis, thanks @jzoldak #751

* You can choose to have query parameters in the Graphite key for the URL, thanks @jeremy-green for the PR #719. To use query parameters in the keys, add --graphiteUseQueryParameters to your run.

version 3.8.1 - 2015-08-16
------------------------
### Fixed
* Parameters passed in the wrong order for basic auth when taking screenshots, thanks @jzoldak for the PR! #691

* Basic Auth was missing when testing one page (since 3.7.0). Thank you Jesse Zoldak (@jzoldak) for the PR! #717
* You can now pass configuration files again. When you do a run, the config.json will be in your result folder. Pass it again with
--configFile to your next run and it will be tested again, but in a new date result dir #270

### Added
* Pass request headers as JSON as complement to all headers in a file #715, thank you Devrim Tufan (@tufandevrim) for the PR.


version 3.7.2 - 2015-07-21

* Send all individual navigation timings to Graphite (before we only sent calculated timings) #580
* Send sitespeed and browser version to Graphite. The keys in Graphite: [namespace].meta.chrome.version, [namespace].meta.firefox.version and [namespace].meta.sitespeed.version #703

### Changed
* Bumping versions: async, cross-spawn-async, fast-stats, fs-extra, handlebars, html-minifier, moment, phantomjs, request, winston, browsertime & xmlbuilder.
* If we just test one page, then skip the crawling (but do one request that checks the status of the page before we start) #706

### Fixed

* When we are at it: also support custom scripts to collect metrics for WebPageTest! Feed your custom javascript metrics file using --wptCustomMetrics. Read more here: https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/custom-metrics #678

* Graphite keys now replaces pipe, comma and plus. If your URL:s has them, they will now be replaced by a underscore. The reason is that some Grafana functions don't work with the special characters. Thanks @EikeDawid for the PR! #679

version 3.5 - 2015-04-24
------------------------
* Rewrite of the Graphite key generation, now always follow the patter protocol.my_domain_com._then_the_path #651.
  The cool thing is that this opens for a lot og Graphite/Grafana goodies, the bad is that if you use it today,
  you need to remap the keys in Grafana to get the graphs.

version 3.4.1  - 2015-04-22
------------------------
* Super ugly quick fix for dubplicate dots in graphite keys #654

version 3.4  - 2015-04-21

version 3.2.0 - 2015-03-18
------------------------
* Check that we got an HAR from WebPageTest before we use the data #596
* We have made it easier to test multiple sites. Add multiple sites by pointing out multiple files like --sites mySite1.txt --sites mySite2.txt. This is done becasue it plays much nicer with our docker images. #579
* Default memory decreased to 256, the old 1024 is only needed when fetching really big sites. 256 is good because it is easier to use oob on small boxes. #610

* You can also create your own box with your own data on the summary page and your own columns and data on the detailed summary page.
* Fetch Navigation Timing API data from a real browser, using Browser Time.

Minor changes

version 1.8.3
------------------------
* Supply a test name that will be shown on all pages. Use the the parameter -n
* Well the problem is like this: Today there is no way to get the ttfb from PhantomJS so it is fetched by a extra request using curl. Some sites that don't cache internally (and are slow) can differ quite much for ttfb, meaning ttfb can be higher the next request than the load time the first time. If this happens it is now highlighted.
* Bug fix: show median front/back end time instead of percentile on summary page
* Bug fix: when the ttfb is larger than pageload, don't add it to summary stats

* Bug fix: Urls containing & broke some tests
* Bug fix: In very rare cases, YSlow reports a larger cache weight than the page weight. The bug is not fixed but when it happens, an error message is displayed
