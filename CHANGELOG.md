# CHANGELOG - sitespeed.io

## Unreleased
-------------------------
### Fixed
* Enable the coach by default.


## 4.0.0-alpha2 - 2016-06-07
-------------------------
### Fixed
* Show results from other plugins even if one plugin has an error (e.g. WebPageTest fails but Browsertime succeeds).
* Fixed preTask and postTaks, now named preScript/postScript, try iy out to login the user.


### Changed
* Added browser and connectivity to Graphite keys, all keys now hold browser and connectivity.

### Added
* Hey we now log the the log file in the result dir.

version 4.0.0-alpha1 - 2016-05-22
-------------------------
### Changed
* Everything! Rewrite from scratch in progress. This is an alpha release, try it test it but do not upgrade in production yet (https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/945).

* We support HTTP/2! In 3.X we used PhantomJS and a modified version of YSlow to analyze best practice rules. We also had BrowserMobProxy in front of our browsers that made it impossible to collect metrics using H2. We now use [the coach](https://github.com/sitespeedio/coach) and Firefox/Chrome without a proxy. That makes it easier for us to adapt to browser changes and changes in best practices.

* We now support the feature that people asked about the most: Measure a page as a logged in user. Use --browsertime.preTask to run a selenium task to before the page is analyzed. Documentation is coming soon.

* New HAR files rock! In the old version we use BrowserMobProxy as a proxy in front of the browser to collect the HAR. In the new version we collect the HAR directly from the browser. For Firefox we use the [HAR export trigger](https://github.com/firebug/har-export-trigger) and in Chrome we generates it from the performance log.

* Stability: We have a new completely rewritten version of [Browsertime](https://github.com/tobli/browsertime) that makes it easier for us to catch errors from the browser, drivers and environment problems.  

* Speed: Yep we dropped Java (it was needed for BrowserMobProxy) and most things are happening in parallel with the new version.

* Don't overload Graphite: One thing that was annoying with 3.x was that it by default sent a massive amount of metrics to Graphite. That's cool in a way but it was too much. We now send curated metrics by default and you can choose to send more.

* You can collect metrics from Chrome on an Android phone. In the current version you need to have it connected using USB to the server running sitespeed.io, lets see how we can make it better in the future.

* Using our Docker container you will get support getting SpeedIndex and startRender using [VisualMetrics](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/visualmetrics). This is highly experimental at this stage.

version 3.11.5 - 2016-01-30
------------------------
### Fixed
* Dependency problem for PhantomJS 2.1. We hope it works now :)

version 3.11.4 - 2016-01-30
------------------------
### Fixed
* Typos #804 Thanks @beenanner

* Making slimerjs more indepenedent from phantomjs #806 thanks @keithamus

version 3.11.2 - 2016-01-13
------------------------
### Fixed
* Browser name in WebPageTest can have spaces and that wasn't handled so when the metrics is sent to Graphite, it fails. #798

### Changed
* Bumped 3rd party dependencies: winston, request, phantomjs, moment, fs-extra, browsertime, cross-spawn-async, async

version 3.11.1 - 2015-10-27
------------------------
### Fixed
* Upgraded Browsertime to new version to work with Node 4

version 3.10.0 - 2015-09-26
------------------------
### Fixed
* Do not report skipped rules as failed on the Budget page. thanks @jzoldak #753
* Grunt-sitespeedio fails the build no matter if GPSI score matches the budget thanks @laer #746
* Fixed the ability to supress domain data beeing sent to Graphite. Using --graphiteData you now need to explicit use domains if you want to send the data (if you don't use all). That data shouldn't always be sent as it was before. (thanks @xo4n for pointing that out) #755

### Added
* Add ability to budget on a per rule basis, thanks @jzoldak #751
* Add waitScript logic to screenshots thanks agaib @jzoldak #737

### Added
* Create same Graphite namespace structure for the domain url as for per-page metrics #728 thanks @JeroenVdb for the PR. Use the flag --graphiteUseNewDomainKeyStructure to turn on the new standard (will become default in 4.0).
* You can choose to have query parameters in the Graphite key for the URL, thanks @jeremy-green for the PR #719. To use query parameters in the keys, add --graphiteUseQueryParameters to your run.

version 3.8.1 - 2015-08-16
------------------------
### Fixed
* Parameters passed in the wrong order for basic auth when taking screenshots, thanks @jzoldak for the PR! #691

version 3.8.0 - 2015-08-10
------------------------
### Fixed
* Removed faulty error logging from WPT if your location missed browser configuration. That was wrong, you actually don't need it.
* Basic Auth was missing when testing one page (since 3.7.0). Thank you Jesse Zoldak (@jzoldak) for the PR! #717
* You can now pass configuration files again. When you do a run, the config.json will be in your result folder. Pass it again with
--configFile to your next run and it will be tested again, but in a new date result dir #270

### Added
* Pass request headers as JSON as complement to all headers in a file #715, thank you Devrim Tufan (@tufandevrim) for the PR.


version 3.7.2 - 2015-07-21

* Send all individual navigation timings to Graphite (before we only sent calculated timings) #580
* Send sitespeed and browser version to Graphite. The keys in Graphite: [namespace].meta.chrome.version, [namespace].meta.firefox.version and [namespace].meta.sitespeed.version #703

### Changed
* Bumping versions: async, cross-spawn-async, fast-stats, fs-extra, handlebars, html-minifier, moment, phantomjs, request, winston, browsertime & xmlbuilder.
* If we just test one page, then skip the crawling (but do one request that checks the status of the page before we start) #706

### Fixed
* Text fixes, thanks @atdt #690
* New Browsertime version fixes Browser name and browser version in the HAR file #704

version 3.6.3 - 2015-06-26

Every  occurrence of {{{URL}}} in your script will be replaced with the URL that is actually going to be tested. Feed the script file to sitespeed.io using --wptScript #623

* When we are at it: also support custom scripts to collect metrics for WebPageTest! Feed your custom javascript metrics file using --wptCustomMetrics. Read more here: https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/custom-metrics #678

* Graphite keys now replaces pipe, comma and plus. If your URL:s has them, they will now be replaced by a underscore. The reason is that some Grafana functions don't work with the special characters. Thanks @EikeDawid for the PR! #679

version 3.5 - 2015-04-24
------------------------
* Rewrite of the Graphite key generation, now always follow the patter protocol.my_domain_com._then_the_path #651.
  The cool thing is that this opens for a lot og Graphite/Grafana goodies, the bad is that if you use it today,
  you need to remap the keys in Grafana to get the graphs.

version 3.2.0 - 2015-03-18
------------------------
* Check that we got an HAR from WebPageTest before we use the data #596
* We have made it easier to test multiple sites. Add multiple sites by pointing out multiple files like --sites mySite1.txt --sites mySite2.txt. This is done becasue it plays much nicer with our docker images. #579

version 2.0  - 2013-10-12
------------------------
Major changes
------
* You can now choose which data that is showed in the summary boxes (the red/yellow/green ones on the start page) and the columns on the detailed summary page.
* You can also create your own box with your own data on the summary page and your own columns and data on the detailed summary page.
* Fetch Navigation Timing API data from a real browser, using Browser Time.
* New modified rule: the YSlow rule yimgnoscale doesn't work with PhantomJS. The new rule compare the image browser width and the real image width.
* The main script (sitespeed.io) has been cleaned up & Velocity templates has been restructured.
* You can now test multiple sites and compare them using the sitespeed-sites.io script (you can choose what kind of data to compare).
* There are now two different rule-sets, one for desktop & one for mobile.

Minor changes
------
* You can now configure the limits for the rules on the summary page.
* Phone view on detailed summary page now only contains url & score to make it simpler to maintain.
* You can now see the IP of the computer running the test in the result.xml file.
* You can now set the max pages to test & the name of the test (displayed on every HTML page).
* Simplified user agent by choosing between iphone, ipad or nexus and a real agent & viewport is set.
* Output as CSV: Choose which column to output and always output ip, start url & date.
* Fix for Windows-users that is having spaces in their path to Java.
* Bug fix: URL:s that returns error (4XX-5XX and that sitespeed can't analyze) is now included in the JUnit xml.
* Bug fix: The JUnit script can now output files to a relative path.
* Bug fix: User Agent is now correctly set.

version 1.8.3
------------------------
* Supply a test name that will be shown on all pages. Use the the parameter -n
* Well the problem is like this: Today there is no way to get the ttfb from PhantomJS so it is fetched by a extra request using curl. Some sites that don't cache internally (and are slow) can differ quite much for ttfb, meaning ttfb can be higher the next request than the load time the first time. If this happens it is now highlighted.
* Bug fix: show median front/back end time instead of percentile on summary page
* Bug fix: when the ttfb is larger than pageload, don't add it to summary stats
* Bug fix: for some sites (very rarely) the total weight was fetched wrong by YSlow, fixed last release for all pages except summary & summary details.

------------------------
* Show percentage of requests & size per content type
* You can now export the pages data to csv (again) with the switch "-o csv"

* On detailed page summary: Categorize favicon as favicon instead of others, and doc type has now an own category
* If an analysis fails, the url and the error from YSlow is now logged
* Cleanup: When you feed sitespeed.io with a list of urls from a file, the text messages is cleaner in the HTML
* Cleanup: Removed old JS table sorter on pages summary, works better now
* Bug fix: If a page was redirected, the gzipped size was fetched as 0, now fixed
* Bug fix: For some sites (example www.bike.se) the total weight was fetched wrong by YSlow, now the weight is calculated from each assets on the pages info page.
* Bug fix: Urls containing & broke some tests
* Bug fix: In very rare cases, YSlow reports a larger cache weight than the page weight. The bug is not fixed but when it happens, an error message is displayed
* Bug fix: Page weight was sometimes wrongly calculated, now each asset weight is used to calculate
