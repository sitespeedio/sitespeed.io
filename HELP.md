# Money
> "Can't we just support you with money?"

We would prefer that you spend your money on people that really needs it, support the [Red Cross](https://www.icrc.org/eng/donations/ways-to-donate/). We will add more specific projects that we want you to support soon.

## Developers
We love to have more people involved in making sitespeed.io better. We are constantly working on adding more documentation and trying to write more information in the issues so its easier to help out. If there's an [issue](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues) that suites you, take it on! If you want help to get started or want to discuss the solution, ping the issue and we can setup a hangout.

## Designers
Help us make the result pages look better! Help us make the documentation look better. You can pretty much help us with everything.

## Documentation
Documentation is fun and it is the core of making software easy to use. Help us out and proof read and add sections that are missing. Documentation for 4.0 happens [here](https://github.com/sitespeedio/doc.sitespeed.io/tree/4.0).

## Tests
We lack a lot of tests for the coming 4.0. Writing tests is a good way to get familiar with the codebase and will help us a lot in the future. A good start is adding support for the code in the [support library](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/tree/master/lib/support).


## Companies
Do you use sitespeed.io in your everyday work? Then we have a perfect proposition for you! Have a hack day with focus on sitespeed.io for your team and contribute back. Pick one the things in the **Help wanted** section. Or maybe there's a function you think is missing? Create it. Contribute back.

# 4.0 a.k.a help wanted
There's a lot that needs to happen before we can release the final 4.0. Checkout the [milestones](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/milestones) and check if there's issues you want to do. Are they lacking info? Ping the issue and we will help you.
