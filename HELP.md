# Help
We want to make sitespeed.io one of the best web performance tool in the world and we hope you can help us!

## Developers
We love to have more people involved in improving sitespeed.io. We are constantly working on adding more documentation and trying to write more information in the issues so its easier to help out. If there's an [issue](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues) that you want to take on, ping the the issue and we can help you get started. You can also [join our Slack channel](https://sitespeedio.herokuapp.com/) if you need help!

## Designers
As a designer there's a lot you can do: You can help us improve the HTML result pages. Maybe we should restructure the metrics  ? Or could the header/footer look better? You could also have look at [https://www.sitespeed.io](https://www.sitespeed.io/) where we have all the documentation. You can pretty much help us with everything, no one in the core team got design skills :)

## Documentation
Documentation is fun and it is the core of making sitespeed.io easy to use. We got a [special documentation tag for issues](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation) that you can use to find where we know we lack documentation. Fixing spelling mistakes is great. Or rewrite parts that you think is too complicated. You can find what you need to send a PR to the documentation [here](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/tree/main/docs).

## Tests
We lack unit tests. You can read about [our testing pipeline](https://www.sitespeed.io/releasing-with-confidence/) that works good for us but more unit tests are always good. A good start is adding support for the code in the [support library](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/tree/main/lib/support).
