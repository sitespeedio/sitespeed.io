# Roadmap (2018-06-16)

This roadmap is the plan for the core team, priorities can and and will change over time. This will give you a view of our current vision and plan.

### Summer (June 2018 -> September 2018)

We have already met our goals for 2018 by releasing 7.0 and continuing being one of the best web performance tools in the world :) During the summer months we gonna take some time to rest and we will only do maintenance releases:

 - When Firefox 61 will become stable we will do a release.

### Late 2018
 - We want to make sure that we are totally independent of other performance tools. That makes it easier for us to move fast.

### Long term
 - Support for Safari on iOS.
