# Roadmap (2019-06-14)

This roadmap is the plan for the core team, priorities can and and will change over time. This will give you a view of our current vision and plan.

### The rest of 2019

When we released 8.0 we really hit a milestone with the new [scripting](https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/scripting/). The rest of 2019 we gonna focus on three things:
* Documentation for performance testing in practice. We lack doumentation for beginners and professionals.
* Create TypeScript definition files for scripting. This is partly done already but needs to be published for feedback.
* [Support for Safari on iOS](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/855).
