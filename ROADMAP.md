# Roadmap (2017-05-23)

This roadmap is the plan for the core team, priorities can and and will change over time. This will give you a view of our current vision and plan.

### Summer (May 2017 -> September 2017)

We have already met our goals for 2017 by releasing 5.0 and continuing being one of the best web performance tools in the world :) During the summer months we gonna take some time to rest and we will only do maintenance releases:

 - The next Selenium release (with Tobias PR) will add support for WebExtensions in Firefox, meaning Firefox users can add request headers, block request and with Firefox 54 we can also tests site behind Basic Auth.
 - We will continue doing new Docker releases when new browsers roll out so you can keep testing with the latest browsers.
 - We will continue to make the documentation better. We still miss the big piece "Web Performance Best Practices" guiding people how they can test.
 - We will always merge your PRs (remember to talk to us first before you spend too much time on the PR).

### Late 2017
 - We want to add support for adding HTML from your plugin [#1141](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1141).
 - We gonna update the Coach with some new guidelines, there are a lot more we can do there.
 - Use the filmstrip [#1555](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1555) and show the images we have.
 - Firefox 57 will need another way of getting the HAR file since it will only support WebExtensions (HAR export trigger is not a WebExtension).

### Long term
 - Support for Safari on iOS.
