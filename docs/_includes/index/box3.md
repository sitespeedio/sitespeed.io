[The coach]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/coach/) gives you performance advice based on best practices for your site. [Browsertime]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/browsertime/) collects metrics, HAR files and records a video of your browser. [Chrome-HAR](https://github.com/sitespeedio/chrome-har) creates a HAR file from Chrome Debugging Protocol data. [Compare](https://compare.sitespeed.io) makes it easy to find regressions comparing HAR files. [PageXray]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/pagexray/) converts a HAR file to a usable JSON structure that tells you more about your page. [Throttle]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/throttle/) helps you simulate slow network connections on Linux and Mac OS X. And finally [sitespeed.io]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sitespeed.io/) is the main tool that uses all the previously mentioned tools and add supports for testing multiple pages as well as adds the ability to report the metrics to a TSDB (Graphite and InfluxDB).
