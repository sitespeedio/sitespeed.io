## We believe in privacy
* * *
We take your privacy really serious: Our [documentation site](https://www.sitespeed.io/), our [dashboard](https://dashboard.sitespeed.io) and our [compare tool](https://dashboard.sitespeed.io) do not use any tracking software at all (no Google Analytics or any other tracking software). None of the sitespeed.io tools call home.

But beware: Chrome and Firefox can call home (we know for fact that they both do). We would love PRs and tips how to make sure browsers don't call home when you run your tests.
