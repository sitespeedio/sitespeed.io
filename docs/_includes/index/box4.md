Do you want to compare your performance against other web sites? Use the performance leaderboard! You can check out our [example dashboard](https://dashboard.sitespeed.io/dashboard/db/leaderboard) or go directly to the [documention]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sitespeed.io/leaderboard/). 

You can compare performance timings, how the page is built, how much CPU the page is using and many many more things. And the leaderboard is also configurable through Grafana, so you can add the metrics that are important to you!
