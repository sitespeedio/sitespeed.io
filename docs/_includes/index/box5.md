Sitespeed.io is Open Source and totally free. But what does it cost to have an instance of sitespeed.io up and running?

If you don't run on your own servers, we recommend running an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) c4.large, storing the data at S3. On one instance you can run something like 80000+ runs per month for a total cost of $695 per year.

Look more into the details [here]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sitespeed.io/performance-dashboard/#cost).
