We've been working on releasing 2.0 of Browsertime for some time and now it's here! You should use Browsertime if you want a raw JSON result for timings and/or execute your own JavaScript. Browsertime is perfect if you wanna build your own performance tool, as VoxMedia did when they created [Lightbike](https://github.com/voxmedia/lightbike) built on top of Browsertime.
