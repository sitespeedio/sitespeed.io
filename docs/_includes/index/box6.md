Sitespeed.io is freely available as Open Source software, with no hidden costs. However, running an instance of the tool does come with some expenses.

To keep costs low, we recommend using cloud/server hosting services such as [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com), and storing data on S3. With one instance, you can run a large number of tests per month, with an estimated cost of around $500 per year.

To get a more detailed understanding of the costs involved, please [refer to our cost breakdown information]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sitespeed.io/performance-dashboard/#cost).
