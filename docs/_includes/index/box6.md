We've been working on releasing 1.0 of Browsertime for some time now and we will soon be there. We have two things we want to correct first. We want to [change the error handling](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/185), so errors that occur are reflected in the resulting JSON. It would also be cool to be able to [add request headers](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/155). Let us know if you can help us!
