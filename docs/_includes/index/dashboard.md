Using sitespeed.io together with Grafana and Graphite enables you to monitor the performance of your web site. We have a prepared [docker-compose file](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml) for your setup and some ready made [generic Grafana dashboards](https://github.com/sitespeedio/grafana-bootstrap-docker/tree/main/dashboards/graphite) that will make it easy for you to get it up and running. You can get it up and running in almost 5 minutes!

We have a version of the dashboard at [dashboard.sitespeed.io](https://dashboard.sitespeed.io/) where you can have look and try it out.

We've been using the dashboards for years and years and it works really good. Read the [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sitespeed.io/performance-dashboard/) on how to set it up and get going.
