intro: After more than a full year of hard work from us (Peter/Tobias/Jonathan and contributors) we finally released 4.0. We did a complete rewrite and also created two new performance tools during that year.

# Sitespeed.io 4.0
Yes finally we have released the 4.0. We (Peter/Tobias/Jonathan and contributors) have been working extremely hard the last year to make this happen.

## Background

When we started 4.0 there was a couple of things that we wanted to fix:

 * We wanted to get rid of YSlow. Yes we know that many people love and use Yslow and we have been using a modified version with our own rules (because some of the original rules did't get updated over time). We wanted something new and modern that could stand the test of time.

 * We want to move to only test in real browsers which support HTTP/2. In 3.x we used PhantomJS to run the YSlow tests. That made us suffer since we had the same limits as PhantomJS (no HTTP/2, incorrect assets sisez etc). To make one thing clear: I love PhantomJS and what Ariya and contributors have done with it. With that said to make sitespeed.io even better, we needed to move to only use real browsers.

 * We wanted a better HAR. In 3.X we used to use BrowserMobProxy and it did not support HTTP/2; it also modified the responses.

 * We want more contributors. 3.X was the first thing we built in NodeJS and we could have surely make the code more readable and easier to understand. We also want a structure to build upon.

 * Test a page as a logged in user. The number one feature that users wanted in sitespeed.io was to be able to login a user and test the performance as a logged in user.

 * Don't overload Graphite with metrics. One of the things I did wrong in 3.x was send all the metrics we collected to Graphite. Graphite got overloaded. Instead we should pick the most important one and make it possible for the user to add the ones they need.

I think that was the list at least the most important things. We have more things on the list that didn't make it to 4.0 but will be coming soon (like InfluxDB support, server for showing the result, etc).

# What we have accomplished in the last year
We released four new Open Source performance tools. Yep four. Lets talk about them and then get into what we've done with sitespeed.io.

## The coach
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/logos/coach.png" class="pull-right img-big" alt="I'm the coach" width="188" height="219">
YSlow is dead, long live the Coach! The coach helps you find performance problems on your page and gives you advice of what you can do better. We use the coach in sitespeed.io but what's extra cool is that it can be used by any tool.

## Browsertime


# 4.0
Lets talk about all the new and shiny things

## HTTP/2

## HAR

## Pre/post-scripts a.k.a login

## Mobile phone

## Graphite keys - generic dashboards

## Log the requests and values
We already got some really cool PRs for 4.0. [Moos](https://github.com/moos) added support in Browsertime to log number of requests and some timing metrics. So when you sit down and go through the logs from sitespeed.io you will see log entries like:

~~~bash
[2016-10-24 15:43:11] 246 requests, 2068.02 kb, firstPaint: 5.57s (±0.34), DOMContentLoaded: 7.33s (±0.34), Load: 25.28s (±1.), rumSpeedIndex: 8.59s (±0.31) (5 runs)
~~~

## Dashboard in 2 seconds
Well almost 2 seconds :) Using our new Docker compose script and ready made dashboards you can get it up and running as fast as the containers are downloaded. We also worked to get the Graphite key structure re-usable between web sites so it's easy to share dashboards.

1. Download our new Docker compose file: curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/master/docker/docker-compose.yml
2. Run: <code>docker-compose up</code>
3. Run sitespeed: <code> docker-compose run sitespeed.io https://www.sitespeed.io/ --graphite.host=graphite</code>
4. Access the dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:3000

does the trick, it will setup all what you need! Using it in productions you should do some tweaks, read more about that [here]().


# What's next (missing in 4.0)
We hoped we could solve everything but ... well it didn't work out. A couple of things that we would like to add in the near future:

* Video and SpeedIndex support. It's already implemented in Browsertime but as an experimental feature. We need to spend time verify and test that the result work in different viewports.

* The server. The server you say? It's a simple server that help you browse and search through the result. And that will make it possible to link between the result HTML pages and runs in Grafana.

* A meaner and cleaner performance budget. One thing that didn't make it to 4.0 was defining a budget on the last run, having the ability to saying if we are 10% slower, or X % bigger than last run, and breaking the build. Coming Soon!

* More love for the waterfall graph. We use [PerfCascade](https://micmro.github.io/PerfCascade/) to view the HAR and that has worked out extremely well on top of that we have some ideas to make it even better.
