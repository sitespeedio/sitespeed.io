intro: After more than a year full of hard work from us (Peter/Tobias/Jonathan and contributors) we finally released 4.0. We did a complete rewrite and also created two new performance tools during that year.

# Sitespeed.io 4.0
Yes finally we have released the 4.0. We (Peter/Tobias/Jonathan and contributors) have been working extremely hard the last year to make this happen.

## Background

When we started 4.0 there was a couple of things that we wanted to fix:

 * We wanted to get rid of YSlow. Yes we know that many people love/uses Yslow and we have been using a modified version with our own rules (because some of the original rules did't get updated over time). We wanted something new and modern that could stand the test of time.

 * We wanna move to only test in real browsers to be able to support HTTP/2. In 3.x we used PhantomJS to run the YSlow tests and that made us suffer so we had the same limits as PhantomJS (no HTTP/2, incorrect assets sisez etc). To make one thing clear: I love PhantomJS and what Ariya and contributors have done with it. But to make sitespeed.io even better, we needed to move only use real browsers.

 * We wanted a better HAR. We used to use BrowserMobProxy and it doesn't support HTTP/2 and also modifies responses.

 * We want more contributors. 3.X was the first thing we built in NodeJS and we could surely make the code more readable and easier to understand. We also want a structure to build upon.

 * Test a page as a logged in user. The number one feature that users wanted in sitespeed.io was to be able to login a user and test the performance as a logged in user.

 * Don't overload Graphite with metrics. One of all the things I did wrong in 3.x was send all the metrics we collected to Graphite. Graphite got overloaded. Instead we should pick the most important one and make it possible for the user to add the ones she needs.

I think that was the list. The most important things at least. We have more things on the list that didn't make it to 4.0 but is coming soon (like InfluxDB support, server for showing the result).

# What we have accomplished the last year
We released four new Open Source performance tools. Yep four. Lets talk about them and then g into what we've done with sitespeed.io.

## The coach

YSlow is dead, long live the Coach! The coach helps you find performance problems on your page and gives you advice of what you can do better. We use the coach in sitespeed.io but what's extra cool is that it can be used by any tool.

Lets talk about all the new and shiny things

## HTTP/2

## HAR

## Pre/post-scripts a.k.a login

## Mobile phone

## Graphite keys - generic dashboards

## Log the requests and values

## Dashboard in 2 seconds

# What's next (missing in 4.0)
We hoped we could solve everything but ... well it didn't work out. A couple of things that we would like to add in the near future:

* Video and SpeedIndex support. It's already implemented in Browsertime but as an experimental feature. We need to spend time verify and test that the result work in different viewports.

* The server. The server you say? It's a simple server that help you browse and search through the result. And that will make it possible to link between the result HTML pages and runs in Grafana.

* A meaner and cleaner performance budget. One thing that didn't make it to 4.0 was defining a budget on the last run, saying if we are 10% slower, or X % bigger than last run, break the build. It will come.

* More love for the waterfall graph. We use [PerfCascade](https://micmro.github.io/PerfCascade/) to view the HAR and that worked out super and we have some ideas to make it even better.
