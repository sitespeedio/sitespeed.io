# sitespeed.io version 7.5
Let us celebrate that today is 6 years ago we released sitespeed.io 1.0! Woho!!!

Ok, celebration is over and let us talk about what's new in 7.5.

## New in 7.5
In 7.5 we push some of the work that has been done this summer. There are some really nice features IMHO.

### Screenshots in Grafana

You can include a screenshot from the run in the annotation by adding <code>--graphite.annotationScreenshot</code> to your configuration.

![Annotation with screenshots]({{site.baseurl}}/img/annotation-with-screenshot.png)
{: .img-thumbnail-center}


### Annotations in Grafana
Instead of using Graphite annotations you can use Grafana built in annotations since sitespeed.io 7.5 and Grafana 5.3.0.

To use Grafana annotations, make sure you setup a *resultBaseURL* and add the host and port to Grafana: <code>--grafana.host</code> and <code>--grafana.port</code>.


### Lighthouse
There's been a couple of tries from users to build a Lighthouse pl

There's also a new Docker container that you can use if you wanna use GPSI and Lighthouse plugin:


### Visual elements
We have upgraded Browsertime to the latest version and one of the new features are timings from visual elements. Try it by adding ```--visuaElements```. Browsertime picks up the largest image and the largest H1. You can also configure your own elements ```--scriptInput.visualElements```. 

First let give creds to the ones that deserves it: As far as we know [Sergey Chernyshev](https://twitter.com/sergeyche) was the first one that introduced the idea of measuring individual elements in his talk [Using Heat Maps to improve Web Performance Metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6l9U5bC8jA). A couple of years later this was implemented by the [Joseph Wynn](https://twitter.com/joseph_wynn) of SpeedCurve, that later on contributed back the implementation to WebPageTest (calling it "hero"-elements). [Patrick Meenan](https://twitter.com/patmeenan) (the creator of WebPageTest) moved on the implementation to [Visual Metrics](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/visualmetrics) that Browsertime uses to pickup visual metrics from the video. We removed the [hero naming]() and now it's ready to use.

### Feed your own script with data
We also added a new feature: If you run your own custom script you can now feed it with different input by using ```--browsertime.scriptInput.*```. Say you have a script named myScript you can pass on data to it with ```--browsertime.scriptInput.myScript 'super-secret-string' ```. More about this in the documentation the coming weeks.

### Direct links to the summary page

When linking to a sitespeed.io result we include index.html in the URL, so that you can use storages that doesn't automagically redirect from / to /index.html (a.k.a Digital Ocean storage).

### Inject JavaScript in your page as early as possible (in Firefox)

You can use ```--injectJs``` to inject JavaScript into the current page (only Firefox at the moment) at document_start. More info: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/contentScripts

### More metrics
Browsertime collects the Firefox only metric *timeToDomContentFlushed*. It is also pushed to Graphite/InfluxDB by deafult.

All metrics in the Paint Timing API (First Paint and First Contentful Paint in Chrome) are also pushed to Graphite/InfluxDB by deafult.

All metrics are also reported with stddev (not only median stdev). This is good when you wanna keep track of how stable metrics you have.

## Bug fixes

* Upgraded to Browsertime 3.7.0 that changed how Basic Auth is handled: We send a basic auth request header instead of using the build in Web Extension [#2151](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2151).

* Chrome in some case(s) generates a HAR with broken timings that caused sitespeed.io to log error and not being able to collect timings per domain [#2159](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2159). Fixed by [#2160](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2160).

* We updated to PageXray 2.4.0 that correctly pick up mime types for video/audio/xml and pdf (that was missed before).

* Fixed the bug that made us show wrong video/screenshot on page summary[#2169](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/pull/2169). Before we always showed the first screenshot/video. Now we show the median pick (so it correlates to the right waterfall and metrics tab).


### Tech
* You can now use markdown in the pug templates - ```!{markdown.toHTML(value)}```
