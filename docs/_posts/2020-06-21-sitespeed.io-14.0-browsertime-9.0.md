# sitespeed.io 14.0 and Browsertime 9.0 

First let us celebrate over [10 million downloads](https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/) of sitespeed.io Docker container!

There are four important new things in the new release:
* New updated Grafana dashboards with all the goodies from Grafana 7.0. All Graphite dashboards is updated: sitespeed.io dashboards, WebPageTest and our plus-1 dashboard.
* You can now see all screenshots for a run in sitespeed.io! This is super useful when you use scripting to test a user journey. You can take screenshots whenever you need and see the result on the result page, making it even easier then before to know what's going on.
* Documentation if you are new into synthetic performance testing
* You can [support us at Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/sitespeedio). We need money to be able to run our test servers, run tests on mobile devices and use a dedicated bare metal server.
