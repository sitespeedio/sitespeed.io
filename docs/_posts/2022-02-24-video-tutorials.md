# Video tutorials
For a couple of years we have had a couple of short video tutorials and we feel should have more of these! Help us to make them better and make it easier for users to use sitespeed.io!

We want (short) video tutorials from you on how to use sitespeed.io:
* Choose a [topic from the list](#topics-to-cover) or come up with a new one
* Make the tutorial in English
* If you want to sync with us first or need help with your setup, you can talk to us on [our Slack channel](https://sitespeedio.herokuapp.com) or in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/new).
* Follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Share the original video with us.

## What's in it for you?
If your video gets accepted you will get a special sticker pack with at least one exclusive sitespeed.io sticker!

Here are of some of our stickers:
