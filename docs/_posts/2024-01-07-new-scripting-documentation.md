# Enhanced scripting documentation

Our [new scripting documentation](https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/scripting/) now comes directly from Browsertime via JSDoc, making it easier to navigate and more user-friendly. While it's a work in progress, we welcome your PRs for improvements.

## IntelliSense and code Completion

We've added IntelliSense/code completion support in Browsertime, improving the scripting experience. This feature is not just limited to Visual Studio Code; we encourage you to set it up in other popular editors. [Detailed instructions](https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/scripting/tutorial-08-Setting-Up-IntelliSense.html) for setting up IntelliSense in Visual Studio Code can be found on our tutorial page. We invite you to try it out in different editors and share your feedback, which will help us enhance our documentation and support for various development environments.

Happy scripting!
