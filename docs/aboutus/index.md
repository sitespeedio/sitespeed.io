# About Us

We are a three member team that works on sitespeed.io in our free time. New contributors and team members are very much welcome!

## Jonathan Lee
<a href="https://twitter.com/beenanner"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/aboutus/jonathan.jpg" class="photo pull-left" width="200" height="200"></a> I discovered sitespeed.io version 3 in 2015 while exploring the latest trending tools in web performance.  I was intrigued by this tool and decided to learn more. Wanting to contribute back to the open source community that has giving me so much over the last decade, I reached out to Peter and Tobias to assist with the development of version 4.0.

As a performance engineer at [CBSi](http://www.cbsinteractive.com/) I am able to offer real-world feedback to the team to make improvements that will benefit others.  I love talking about web performance so feel free connect or reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanlee20) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/beenanner).


## Tobias Lidskog
<a href="https://twitter.com/tobiaslidskog"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/aboutus/tobias.jpg" class="photo pull-left" width="200" height="200"></a> Having been supporter of sitespeed.io from the sidelines for some time, I joined Peter as we started working on version 3.0. I've been working professionally with the web for about 15 years, and open source tools have been an indispensable help all along. Now it's nice to be able to give something back.

In my work at [iZettle](https://www.izettle.com/) I spend most of my time enabling the dev teams to shine. Working on sitespeed.io is a great complement, letting me get my hands dirty with range of tools and techniques; from [controlling browsers with WebDriver](http://www.browsertime.net) to [learning how to use Docker](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io-docker).

## Peter Hedenskog
<a href="https://twitter.com/soulislove"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/aboutus/peter.jpg" class="photo pull-left" width="200" height="200"></a>  I created sitespeed.io late 2012. It's been a lot of work and incredibly [fun](http://www.peterhedenskog.com/blog/2015/02/building-a-new-sitespeed.io/)! I'm a web performance geek, love the web and think Open Source is the way forward. I work in the performance team at [Wikimedia](https://www.wikimedia.org/).

In early 2015 I was awarded for building sitespeed.io by [The Swedish Internet Infrastructure Foundation](https://www.iis.se/english/about-iis/) making it possible for me to work full time on the project for three months.

I'm one of the organizers of the [Stockholm Web Performance meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Web-Performance-Group/). We are 700+ members and are always looking for new speakers. If you are in Stockholm and have something to share, ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/soulislove">Twitter</a> and see if we can make it happen.
