# Browsertime
{:.no_toc}

Access the Web Performance Timeline, from your browser, in your terminal!

Browsertime allows you to:

* Query timing data directly from the browser, to access [Navigation Timing](http://kaaes.github.io/timing/info.html), [User Timing](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webperformance/usertiming/),
[Resource Timing](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/), first paint and [RUM Speed Index](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/RUM-SpeedIndex).
* Generate [HAR](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/) files
* Run custom Javascript scripts in the browser and get statistics for each run.

* Lets place the TOC here

## A simple example

~~~
$ bin/browsertime.js https://www.sitespeed.io
~~~

Load https://www.sitespeed.io in Chrome three times. Results are stored in a json file (browsertime.json) with the timing data, and a har file (browsertime.har) in `browsertime-results/www.sitespeed.io/$date/`

- iOS Safari (mobile) - Waiting on WebDriver support

## How does it work

Browsertime uses Selenium NodeJS to drive the browser. It starts the browser, load a URL, executes configurable Javascripts to collect metrics, collect a HAR file.

To get the HAR from Firefox we use the [HAR Export Trigger](https://github.com/firebug/har-export-trigger) and Chrome we parse the timeline log and generates the HAR file.

Oh and you can run your own Selenium script before (<code>--preScript</code>) and after (<code>--postScript</code>) a URL is accessed, so you can login/logout or do whatever you want.


## The rewrite to 1.0

The master is to a large degree a re-write of the internal implementation, the cli interface, and the node API. It's
based on the learnings from the previous releases of Browsertime, and their use in Sitespeed.io. It's still lacking some features
from the 0.x releases, and the API is not final. However it should be a better foundation for future development, using
more modern Javascript features and a much more extensive test suite.

- With 1.0 we've dropped BrowsermobProxy, so you don't need Java to run it. This makes each run significantly faster. :smile:
- We now support HTTP/2!
- If you want to do things before or after the URL is tested we support pre and post selenium scripts.

If you would would like to get started there are a few examples that can be found in the [docs folder](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/tree/master/docs/examples). If you run into any issues getting started using Browsertime visit our [issues page](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues) for some common issues/solutions. If you still cannot resolve the problem and feel the issue is within browsertime feel free to open an issue.
