# Continuous Integration
{:.no_toc}

Use sitespeed.io to keep track of what is happening with your site and make sure you know that you donâ€™t break the performance best practice rules before your changes are released. Your build can also be broken if has too many assets, are too big or too slow. And of course, if you use WebPageTest you can use the metrics from them to break your build.

You can define your own budget file with rules on when to break your build. You will get an error return status after the run or you can choose to output JUnit XML and TAP.

* Lets place the TOC here
