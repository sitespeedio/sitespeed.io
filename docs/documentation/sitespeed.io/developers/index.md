## Start
Start by looking at the image of [how it all works]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sitespeed.io/how-it-all-works/). It seems much but it isn't so complicated.

### Plugins
Everything in sitespeed.io (almost everything) is a plugin. Each plugin will be called on startup, for each message sent in the application and one call when everything is finished.

The [plugin structure]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sitespeed.io/plugins/#create-your-own-plugin) looks like that.

### Analyzing a URL step by step
The flow is like this:

1. You start the application and feed it with a URL/URLs.
2. The app will go through the configured plugins and start them and the plugins will wait for messages.
3. The app will send the URLs as URL messages and the plugins that listens to that type of messages will act on that. When they are finished with what they do, they post other messages on with the findings they did.
4. When all URLs are finished, the plugins will get a "close" call to say prepare what you have.
5. Finish

The overall idea is pretty simple. 

### Contributing to the Documentation
First make sure you have Bundler: <code>gem install bundler</code>

*If you run on a Mac OS make sure you have xcode-select installed: <code>xcode-select --install</code>*

To run the documentation server locally execute the following from within the /docs directory after cloning the repo locally: <code>bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''</code>. 

Vist https://localhost:4000/ in the browser of your choice.


### Debugging with Chrome
You can debug sitespeed.io using Chrome and NodeJS > 6. Thanks [@moos](https://github.com/moos) for sharing.

~~~ bash
$ node --inspect --debug-brk bin/sitespeed.js -m25 -n1 http://0.0.0.0:8082
Debugger listening on port 9229.
Warning: This is an experimental feature and could change at any time.
To start debugging, open the following URL in Chrome:
    chrome-devtools://devtools/remote/serve_file/@62cd277117e6f8ec53e31b1be5829 a6f7ab42ef/inspector.html?experiments=true&v8only=true&ws=localhost:9229/node
~~~

Then copy&paste the URL in chrome and you're in inspect mode. <code>--debug-brk</code> ensures a breakpoint as soon as the code is entered. From there, you can start any of the profiles under the Profile tab.

Use it when you wanna debug functionality or check memory usage.
