 * [Configure Metrics](configure-metrics/) - configure which metrics you want to send to Graphite/InfluxDB.
 * [CPU](cpu/) - measure CPU metrics to see where your page spends the time.
 * [CPU Benchmark](cpu-benchmark/) - benchmark the CPU that runs your browser and tests.
 * [Chrome User Experience Report](crux/) - collect Chrome User Experience Report data in sitespeed.io.
 * [Developers](developers/) - start here when you want to do PRs or create a plugin.
