Sitespeed.io is the complete toolbox to test the web performance of your web site. Use it to monitor your performance or checkout how your competition is doing. You can see all the latest changes in the [Changelog](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the project.

 * [Introduction](introduction/) - start here if you are new to the project or web performance testing.
 * [Installation](installation/) - install using npm, yarn or run our Docker containers.
 * [Configuration](configuration/) - there's a lot of things you can do with sitespeed.io, lets checkout how!
 * [Browsers](browsers/) - collect timings using real browsers. We support Firefox, Chrome and Chrome on Android.
 * [Connectivity](connectivity/) - set the connectivity to emulate real users network conditions.
 * [Performance Dashboard](performance-dashboard/) - keep track of your metrics and performance.
 * [Alerts](alerts/) - send alerts (email/Slack/PagerDuty etc) when you get a performance regression.
 * [F.A.Q and Best Practice](best-practice/) - here we keep track of questions we get in Slack.
 * [Performance Budget](performance-budget/) - make sure you are within your performance budget.
 * [Plugins](plugins/) - list/disable/enable or create your own plugin.
 * [Pre/post scripting](prepostscript/) - run Selenium scripts before/after you test a URL.
 * [Setup S3](s3/) - how to setup S3 for your html result/videos and screenshots.
 * [Metrics](metrics/) - configure which metrics you want to use.
 * [Continuous Integration](continuous-integration/) - generate JUnit XML/TAP and use Jenkins, Grunt or the Gulp plugin.
 * [Docker](docker/) - how to use our Docker containers.
 * [Graphite](graphite/) - how to configure and store your metrics in Graphite (and using StatsD).

 * [Developers](developers/) - start here when you want to do PRs or create a plugin.
 * [How to Write a Good Bug Report](bug-report/) - if you write a good bug report, we can spend more time helping you fixing the problem instead of asking you questions.
