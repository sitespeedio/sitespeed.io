# Throttle
{:.no_toc}

* Lets place the TOC here
{:toc}

## Introduction

**Throttle lets you *simulate slow network connections* on Linux and Mac OS X.**

Throttle uses *pfctl* on Mac and *tc* on Linux (you also need *ip* and *route* for Throttle to work on Linux) to simulate different network speeds and is inspired by [tylertreat/Comcast](https://github.com/tylertreat/Comcast), the [connectivity setting in the WPTAgent](https://github.com/catchpoint/WebPageTest.agent/blob/master/internal/traffic_shaping.py) and [sltc](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sltc).

**What is Throttle good for?**

It is usually used for two different things:

 - You run it as a standalone tool setting simulate different connection speeds.
 - You integrate it in your (web performance) tool to simulate different connections.

You can set the download/upload speed and/or RTT. Upload/download is in kbit/s and RTT in ms.


## Install

```bash
npm install @sitespeed.io/throttle -g
```

On OSX, add these lines to ```/etc/pf.conf``` if they don't exist, to prevent the ```pfctl: Syntax error in config file: pf rules not loaded``` error when you try to run throttle

```shell
pf_enable="YES"
pflog_enable="YES"
```

## Start simulate a slower network connection

Here is an example for running with 3G connectivity. Remember: Throttle will use sudo so your user will need
sudo rights.

```bash
throttle --up 330 --down 780 --rtt 200
```

## Pre made profiles
To make it easier we have pre made profiles, check them out by *throttle --help*:

```shell
--profile         Premade profiles, set to one of the following
                     3g: up:768 down:1600 rtt:150
                     3gfast: up:768 down:1600 rtt:75
                     3gslow: up:400 down:400 rtt:200
                     2g: up:256 down:280 rtt:400
                     cable: up:1000 down:5000 rtt:14
                     dsl: up:384 down:1500 rtt:14
                     3gem: up:400 down:400 rtt:200
                     4g: up:9000 down:9000 rtt:85
                     lte: up:12000 down:12000 rtt:35
                     edge: up:200 down:240 rtt:35
                     dial: up:30 down:49 rtt:60
                     fois: up:5000 down:20000 rtt:2
```

You can start throttle with one of the premade profiles:

```bash
throttle --profile 3gslow
```

or even simpler
```bash
throttle 3gslow
```

## Stop simulate the network
Stopping is as easy as giving the parameter *stop* to throttle.

```bash
throttle --stop
```

or

```bash
throttle stop
```

## Add delay on your localhost
This is useful if you run [WebPageReplay](https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult/blob/main/web_page_replay_go/README.md) and want to add some latency to your tests.

```bash
throttle --rtt 200 --localhost
```

## Stop adding delay on localhost

```bash
throttle --stop --localhost
```

## Use directly in NodeJS


```javascript
import throttle from '@sitespeed.io/throttle'
// Returns a promise
throttle.start({up: 360, down: 780, rtt: 200}).then(() => ...
```

or

```javascript
import throttle from '@sitespeed.io/throttle'
// Returns a promise
const options = {up: 360, down: 780, rtt: 200};
await throttle.start(options);
// Do your thing and then stop
await throttle.stop();
```

## Log all commands

You can log all the commands that sets up the throttling by setting LOG_THROTTLE=true.

```
LOG_THROTTLE=true throttle 3gslow
```

or use the CLI command `--log`:

```
throttle 3gslow --log
```

## Run in Docker (on Linux)

Make sure to run ```sudo modprobe ifb numifbs=1``` before you start the container.

And then when you actually start your Docker container, give it the right privileges with ```--cap-add=NET_ADMIN```

You can also [use Docker networks]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sitespeed.io/connectivity/#docker-networks) to change connectivity when testing inside a container.
