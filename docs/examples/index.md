## sitespeed.io

Sitespeed.io uses Browsertime, the Coach and PageXray to collect and generate the result, so looking at result pages from sitespeed.io will give you a idea of what you can get from all tools. Analyzing two pages using Chrome looks like this:

~~~bash
docker run --shm-size=1g --rm -v "$(pwd)":/sitespeed.io sitespeedio/sitespeed.io -b chrome https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama
~~~

Gives the following [report](https://examples.sitespeed.io/6.0/2017-11-23-23-43-35/). The standard use case for sitespeed.io is to run it continously and send the data to Graphite/Grafana and create dashboards looking like this:

[![Example dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/img/examples/dashboard-examples.png)](https://dashboard.sitespeed.io/dashboard/db/page-summary?orgId=1)

Checkout our [example dashboard](https://dashboard.sitespeed.io/dashboard/db/page-summary?orgId=1) to see what it looks like to use sitespeed.io to continuously measure performance.

## Browsertime
Browsertime collects metrics using JavaScript and will record the browser window using FFMPEG and produce a JSON file with the metrics collected, a HAR file that describes the request/responses and video and screenshots.

~~~bash
docker run --shm-size=1g --rm -v "$(pwd)":/browsertime sitespeedio/browsertime https://www.sitespeed.io/
~~~

It will generate a HAR file, a video and a browsertime.json that hold all the metrics.

PageXray will convert your HAR file to a new JSON format. If your HAR file is from WebPageTest or Browsertime it will pickup some extra info.

Run it locally in NodeJS or in the browser:

~~~bash
pagexray --pretty /path/to/my.har
