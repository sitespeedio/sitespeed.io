# Welcome to the wonderful world of Web Performance

Sitespeed.io is a [set of Open Source tools](/documentation/) that makes it easy to monitor and measure the performance of your web site.

Measuring performance shouldn't be hard: you should be able to have full control of your metrics, own your own data and you should be able to do it without paying top dollars.

That's why we created sitespeed.io.
