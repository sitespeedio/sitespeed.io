<div class="section">
Sitespeed 1.3 was relased the 15th of November 2012. The main goal with the release was to make all result pages responsive, so they can be viewable on a phone/tablet in a nice looking way. 


        <h2>Improvements</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>All result pages are now responsive, standard stuff except the table in pages.vm, two different tables, one for phones, one for the rest</li>
	  <li>Moved webpagetest link from pages.vm to page, to make more space, because the page was broken on tablets</li>
	  <li>Added the summary data also on page.vm</li>
	  <li>Added possibility to output all page data as csv file (yes that old thing)</li>
	  <li>Added possibility to output every html file as png, for easy include in documents/web etc</li>
	  <li>Added (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/" target="_blank">htmlcompressor</a>) to compress all html, to make the result pages smaller</li>
	  <li>Upgraded to latest version of the crawler (that version is smaller in size )</li>
	  <li>Added support for testing only one page (depth = 0), thanks <a href="https://github.com/tomsutton1984" target="_blank">@tomsutton1984</a> for the idea</li>
	  </ul>
