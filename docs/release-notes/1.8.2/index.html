  <h1>Sitespeed.io 1.8.2 release notes</h1>
</div>

<p>The 1.8.2 release contains some new small features, cleanup & bug fixes.</p>

<h3>New features/enhancements</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>CSV export</strong> - you can now export the pages data to a CSV file (added it again) with the switch "-o csv"</li>
	<li><strong>Content type percentage</strong> - the detailed page now show percentage of requests & size per content type</li>
	<li><strong>Better error reporting</strong> - a URL that fails e.g. breaks the test, now logs the exact URL, the error message and add the URL to the error list. Also if a cookie is wrongly set, the URL that sets the cookie is logged. Also the Java & PhantomJS version is always shown</li>
	<li><strong>Content categories</strong> - Favicon and the document are now own categorizes in the detailed page summary</li>
	<li><strong>Cleanup</strong> - before two different Javascript column sorters was used (on different pages), now one is used</li>
	<li><strong>Cleanup</strong> - the output is cleaner if you run a test with a list of URLs from a file</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>	
<li>If a page was redirected, the gzipped size was before fetched as 0</li>
<li>For some sites (example www.bike.se) the total weight was fetched wrong by YSlow, now the weight is calculated from each assets on the pages info page</li>
<li>URLs containing & broke some tests</li>
<li>In very rare cases, YSlow reports a larger cache weight than the page weight. The bug is not fixed but when it happens, an error message is displayed</li>
