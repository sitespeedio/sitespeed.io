There's a couple of ways you can help us building sitespeed.io:

* If you are a user of sitespeed.io you can help us make the documentation better. Start by reading [how to contribute to the documentation](/documentation/sitespeed.io/developers/#contributing-to-the-documentation).
* If you are a developer, you can help us with bug fixes and pull requests. We have a [special page for you to start](/documentation/sitespeed.io/developers/).
* If you are a designer you can help us with the design of the result pages. Please [get in touch with us](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/new) and we can help you get started.
* If you are a company or organisation using one of the sitespeed.io tools, you can either set aside time for your employees to contribute back or you can [sponsor us with money](https://opencollective.com/sitespeedio). Money will secure that we can keep running sitespeed.io with the high quality we've been known for.

## Why should you sponsor?
Sponsorships will help us continue working on open source software, keeping the documentation updated and upgrade and add more test servers (we only run two at the moment) that makes sure our releases are as bug free as possible.

At the moment we run two servers sponsored by Digital Ocean: One running Grafana/Graphite/InfluxDB and one instance that runs the latest commit in main for sitespeed.io and collect metrics using [https://github.com/sitespeedio/dashboard.sitespeed.io](https://github.com/sitespeedio/dashboard.sitespeed.io). 

We want to run at least one more instance to be able to test changes direct in Browsertime. That would help us a lot finding issues earlier. With sponsor money we could also choose to use other cloud providers and making it easier to deploy sitespeed.io.

We also want to find a place to host our mobile phones, so we can continue to run tests directly on mobile devices.
