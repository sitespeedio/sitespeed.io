If you need help or support then:

1. Try `--help`! Most sitespeed.io tools support the `--help` parameter. Try `sitespeed.io --help` and see what you can do with the tool.
2. We try to document all the things, so read the [documentation](/documentation/). 
3. We have a lot of documentation. Sometimes its hard to find the thing you need, try the [search](/search/).
4. If you don't find what you need, [search Github open/closed issues](https://github.com/search?q=org+sitespeedio&type=Issues). The project been alive for many years and you can  get a lot of help in closed Github issues.
5. If you still haven't found what you need, [join our Slack channel](https://sitespeedio.herokuapp.com/) and tell us about your problem.


If you have a bug, please read [How to do a reproducable bug report](https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/bug-report/) and file your bug under the project you think match.
