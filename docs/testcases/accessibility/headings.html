    <h1>Curtis Mayfield - New World Order</h1>
    <p>Darkness no longer, a child is born
    Mother shed tears of joy as baby test his lungs
    My daddy's not there where he ought to be
    Somewhere in Georgia, skinning and shooting craps on his knees</p>
    <h3>Heading</h3>
    <p>Another victim born out here in the hood
    And based on statistics it really ain't all good
    Welfare takes the tab and daddy can't sign
    And it can't be seen, the family becomes a crime</p>
    <h4>Heading</h4>
    <p>The hunt is on and brother you're the prey
    Serving time in jail, it just ain't the way
    I'm living so hard, baby, that my hair is gray
    We got to make a change, it's a brand new day</p>
    <h5>Heading</h5>
    <p>A new world order, a brand new day
    A change of mind for the human race
    A new world order, a brand new day
    A change of mind for the human race</p>
    <p>Operation influx and it's on the way
    We've just marched a million plus the other day
    Look we all witnessed the sweat rolling down Ms Liberty's head
    She knows the sleeping giant is no longer sleeping dead</p>
    <p>Oh, what a fulfillment of prophecy
    Let us teach the children freedom's never been free
    It's okay to cry, go ahead and cry
    'Cause Jesus wept but hope and faith he kept
    It's a new day</p>
    <h6>Heading</h6>
    <p>A new world order, a brand new day
    A change of mind for the human race
    A new world order, a brand new day
    A change of mind for the human race</p>
