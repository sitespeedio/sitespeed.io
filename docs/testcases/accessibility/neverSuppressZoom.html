  <h1>Horace Andy - Skylarking</h1>
  <pre>Skylarking, skylarking,
That's what youths do today.
Skylarking, skylarking,
Before they stand up, firm on their feet.

Get, a likkle work, a likkle work,
And earn their bread honestly..

Beggin' you a five cent, sir,
Beggin' you a ten cent, sir,
Cannot help, no, cannot help..

So if you all keep on doing, what you all are doing,
You will end up, up, up in chains.
