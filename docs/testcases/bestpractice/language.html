  <h1>Donnie Frittz - Rainbow Road</h1>
<pre>
I was born a dirt poor man
All my life I've had hard working hands
But I sang my song as I carried my load
Cause I had a dream about rainbow

Rainbow road

Then one day a man came along
Heard me playing and singing my songs
He bought me clothes and paid up every debt I owed
Sent me on my way down rainbow

Rainbow road

Then one night a man with a knife
Pushed me till I had to take his life
Fast as falling all my friends were gone
That old judge traded me a sentence for a song
Now I'm living with this ball and chain
I had to wear a number before they ever heard my name
And like the dream I'm growing old
But we still sing about rainbow

Rainbow road
