  <h1>Stevie Wonder - What Christmas Means To Me</h1>
  <pre>Oh yeah...
Candles burnin' low,
Lots of mistletoe.
Lots of snow and ice,
Everywhere we go.
Choirs singin' carols,
Right outside my door.

All these things and more
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

Oh yeah,
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

And ya know what I mean
I see your smilin' face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
And little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

All these things and more, darling
(All these things and more)
Whoa!
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)
