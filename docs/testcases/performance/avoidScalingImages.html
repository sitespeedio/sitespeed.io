  <h1>Tammi Terrell - This Old Heart Of Mine</h1>
  <pre>This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away I feel you're gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow
Bringin' ya back again, hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love that I feel inside
'cause each day that passes by
Ya got me never knowin' if I'm comin' or goin' 'cause

I love you, yes, I do
This old heart (ooh)
I love you, yes, I do
Yes, I do, wait for me

I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keep me cryin'
The way you're treatin' me leaves me incomplete
Yeah, you're here for the day, gone for the week

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want
I'm not too proud to shout it, tell the world about it 'cause

I love you
This old heart (this old heart) waits for you
And I love ya!

I love you (hoo hoo)
This old heart waits for you

This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away I feel you're gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow
Bringin' ya back again, hurtin' me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside, girl
'Cause each day that passes by
Ya got me never knowin' if I'm comin' or goin' 'cause

I love you, yes, I do (old heart of mine waits for you)
I love you, yes, I do
Yes, I do
I love you
This old heart, darlin' (this old heart)
Will wait for you
I love you
This old heart, darlin' (this old heart)
Will wait for you
I love you, yes, I do, yes, I-I-I-I do
I love you, yes, I do, yes, I-I-I-I do
I love you

Oh, yeah, been broke a thousand times</pre>
